Whips on whips, my ancestors got they backs out (yeah, oh)
Too far? Five hundred stacks for the hood (I dare you, nigga)

They ain't gettin' paper like they should, wait

Niggas ain't really on the type of shit he on
I hit Drizzy and told him I had a milli' for him (oh shit)
I own my companies full, told 'em to keep the loan
I took that gold bitch home, niggas is big mad (oh shit)

It's different, it's really different (catch up niggas)
Ayo, I might sled in Utah, LA too warm
My nigga tall, look like a bitch, I call him Mulan (hey, oh)
Salad colored emerald on finger, the size of croutons
Niggas cannot fuck with performance of Magic New Wand (oh, nigga)
That's my nuance, used to be the weirdo (gahdammit)
Used to laugh at me, listen to me with their ears closed (niggas is wilidn')
Used to treat me like that boy off Malcolm in the Middle (I'm fuckin' rich)
Now I'm zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero (not six)
Rolls Royce pull up (zero), black boy hop out (not seven)
Man, I can't take this shit no more, man, I quit 
I quit, I swear to God, nigga (that's it)

Fuckin' crumbs
Wish-a-nigga-would face
Fuck you mean, nigga?
Ladies and gentlemen
We just landed in Geneva
Yeah, that's in Switzerland
We on a yacht
A young lady just fed me French vanilla ice cream
We all got our toes out, too
Call me when you get lost
I'ma travel the globe, you keep the block hot
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurt
Find us, we playin' hide-and-seek with the passports
Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us, yeah
The luggage is pilin', I needed clothes to wear
So many stinkies sit in my wallet, look like a folding chair
The Cartier so light on my body, thought I floated here
We bolded here, it's Tunechi and Tyler but call me Baudelaire, yeah
Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch, yeah, we kissin', dawg
I love when she let me rub her like Michelin
A hundred grand to sleep on a bird, the wings are whistlin' like
Man, they ain't listenin'
Cross the line like immigrants and benefit from it
Keep on stuntin' on these niggas
Make 'em sick to they stomach, man (you can't stop it)
Y'all don't understand, fish so fresh that you could taste the sand
Yeah, we gettin' lost but we know who we am (true story)
By the, by the, by the, by the some-some-somethin'
Treat that last part like you niggas ain't sayin' nothin'
Yeah, haha
You see these excursions right here?
Just too lavish to post on the 'Gram (Gangsta Grillz)
Uh (Tunechi)
Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard to me
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beepin'
I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat
Got my middle fingers to the cameras, that's what Carter meet
From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering
I'm on the beat, check out my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
The speed of my plum so great, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flaw, may eat me a rapper, I might as well eat me a ho
I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin' the cold
As the devil and demon and ghost
I'ma get even and even get even some more
It's too late to even get low, baow
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, that's what I need you to know
Mula, Weezy the GOAT
The wind beneath my wings, Desert Eagle underneath my coat
Yeah, Mula (Bitch)
All aboard, nigga
You see
We just over here admirin' the view of the mountains from the lake
Of course
Y'all know it's Wolf Haley, man, stop fuckin' playin'
Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near 20 and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes, just wide
My passport is the most valuable-
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me-, I'ma just go
Yeah, when I turned 23 that's when puberty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit me
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shifting, that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changing from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts change so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they love me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at 1-9
Mom was in the shelter when "Yonkers" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken that shit is stupid
The flower gets its petal, they pluck it but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs longer than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me up but I keep short like Caesar
Eyes open if I pray 'cause I can't trust God either, uh
Seeing that we only got one life to live
How far do you really wanna take it?
Don't let 'em ever tell you nothin' you can't do
Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-o-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle, covered in grass, lacking gravel
It come with two boats and cattle
I'm livin' sweet ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me run, like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungarees because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, no my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me, "It's not good" from your lunch break
Holiday season
A vision you have to understand from perspective
Check your resources, nigga
Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see as a kid
I felt alienated by the niggas who look just like me
Niggas treat my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance so
So I was like, I was like "fuck 'em, fuck 'em"
I did my own shit and now I'm up
And now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous
I ain't never had anxiety
I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
And you talk about that nigga? I'm him
I'm him, I'm that nigga
It's funny, right? (Right)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gonna be here (whoa)
See for y'all, the sky is the limit
For us, the sky is just what we stand on to reach the beyond
High above the clouds as you see us (Gangsta)
Catch up, niggas
Bitch, I'm runnin' up a check like I got Rafs on (right)
And I'm runnin' outta shit 'cause I got Rafs on me (right)
Bitch, I'm runnin'
Bitch, I'm runnin'
We gon' run it up (bitch, I'm runnin')
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up (bitch, I'm runnin')
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (we gon' run it up)
Here today but gone tomorrow (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all(we gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (we gon' run it up)
Here today but gone tomorrow (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (we gon' run it up)
Here today but gone tomorrow (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
He off the dope (yah)
We off it, we off the boat, true story (okay)
The heat off, we tee off, like G-olf, we (phew-phew-phew)
We be off the scope, so I
Brand new, Bunnyhop been zoomed in
Ever since I hit two tens
Of the faces with the blue skin
With the green background, don't know how to act now
But I need you like you're my bluefin
Fiends moonwalk when I come
Deaf ho speak when I'm here
The dead hit sprints when I hum
Why you actin' so dumb? Bitch, you know I got the fuss
I'm live from the 310
You ain't got bling, it been tired (oh)
No lattes and foes, I sell wires
Gumballs cool me down, I'm on fire
Can't fuck with' 'em
Wrap (run, run, run)
Help us see clear when the lighting was dim, dim
We ain't nothin' to you but we somethin' to them, them
When you in your room, then you starin' at the ceilin'
Dreamin', I want you to know it's no ceilings
I want you to notice that feelin'
I want you to leave and go for it
I want you to reach with no fearin'
Throat clearin', scream it, let 'em hear
Run that shit off, baby
Yeah (we gon' run it up, we gon' run it up)
Let's go, baby (we gon' run it up, we gon' run it up)
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
Here today but gone tomorrow (we gon' run it up, we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (we gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (we gon' run it up)
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
I'm runnin' like a politician
I'm runnin' like, I'm runnin' like
I'm runnin' like the water on the dirty dishes
I'm runnin', I'm runnin' like there's roaches in the kitchen
I'm runnin' like the
I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
I'm runnin' like you're not tryna catch it with me
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like (I'm broke)
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like (nah, I told you)
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like
I'm runnin' like, runnin' like
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it, we gon' run it
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
Lil white bitch gon' say
"You need to say something about that"
"You need to say some 'bout Black"
Bitch, suck my
Yeah
That ain't your religion, you just followin' your mammy
She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask her?
Questions, it's holes in them stories
Is it holes in your blessings? Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer, but I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all
Just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul comes, let them serpents rattle, baby
Crackin' light, broke porcelain, bitch
We ocean deep if you just pour us in a portion of shit
Them people try to twist my view, on some contortionist shit
I had to reevaluate what was important and shit
Finder's keeper's when you creep inside, my mind is madness
If I see peace, I'm like a fiend, uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in
How I'm supposed to be protected when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause our skin is the Black type
Teach me everything and be amazed I don't act right
What the fuck?
I'm tappin' the matrix, I'm back and they hated
I'm Black and make 'em pay me capital statements, you dig?
Word on my back, I'm tryna fashion a statement
I ain't no bastard, we the master of the path that we blazin', you dig?
What?
On God now
I came a long way from my past, nigga, it's obvious
V12 engine, I'm fishtailing on some sloppy shit
Internet ringin', no lyrics up, like I hide this shit
What's your address? I could probably send you a copy, bitch
I was cancelled before cancelled was with Twitter fingers
Protestin' outside my shows, I gave them the middle finger
I was a teener, tweetin' Selena crazy shit, didn't want to offend her
Apologize when I seen her, back when I was tryna fuck Bieber, just in
I say with my chest out, you say with your chest in, nigga (say it with your chest, nigga)
Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this
Hit some protests and retweeted positive messages
Donated some funds, then I went and copped me a necklace
I'm probably a coon, your standards based on this evidence
Am I doing enough or not doing enough?
I'm tryna run with the baton, but see, my shoe's in the mud
I feel like, anything I say, dog, I'm screwin' shit up (Sorry)
So I just tell these Black babies, they should do what they want
Freedom, need 'em
My niggas, seen 'em
Free 'em
Don't fuck with the law, like damn, Gina
So calm the fuck down before we duck rounds
And fire balls that make your family have to duck the fuck down
We frontline, we got the mazel tov that we can chuck now
'Cause anytime we movin' up, it's like a "what the fuck?" now
They playin' games, we strappin' up, we cock and aim
We aim to shoot, we shoot to claim what we need
We done with pain and the grieving
Niggas is done with the peace
Whether it's personal or for the whole of niggas, indeed
I might not have dreadlocks, I might have these gold teeth
But I'm a nigga like you, and you's a nigga like me
So let's be niggas together, and let's be niggas with plans
But put this plastic on first, 'cause shit is hittin' the fan, Scott
Shit like this make me wanna turn my baseball cap to the side
You know, with the T.I. lean
Y'all fake mad
Catch up, niggas
Gettin' y'all identity, huh? (Gangsta Grillz)
Go get a fuckin' hobby, shit
Ain't nobody perfect
Well, at least y'all ain't
No, no, no, no, no, no, listen, listen (call me when you get lost, lost)
The driver gon' drop you off
Alright, it's warm (call me when you get lost, lost)
The waterfall is crazy
I don't know, make somethin' up, tell him somethin'
Uh, come on
Still on the boat
Call me if you get lost
You and I, we fell in love
I ain't read the signs, ain't know what it was
But God gotta know he might have peaked when he made you
The cosmos' only mistake is what they named you (what that mean?)
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar
'Cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, sugar, oh, you're so sweet
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known
Baby, you're the sweetest thing
Even if
You left me out here stranded
My feelings wouldn't change a bit
(You know how I feel about you, are you ready?)
You know how I feel, baby
Infinite
The love I have for you, a diamond couldn't put a dent in it (uh, go to the bridge thing, okay)
Darling, you're the wind under my wings
My heart beats triple time when I see you
Somethin' I can't control
If I compared you, the sun is a stand-in (sun)
You got a smile that could light up a planet (smile) yeah (oh, oh)
And I just wanted you to know (they should call you sugar)
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar (why?)
'Cause you're so sweet to me (sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar (sugar) you're so sweet (oh, oh)
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known (ooh, girl)
You're the sweetest
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet (sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar (why?)
'Cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, you're so sweet (you're so sweet to me)
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest (I know)
And you look so good (yeah)
And you smell so good (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you taste so good (yeah)
And you're so, so good (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the sweetest (yeah)
Yeah, you are, ha-ha
Sweet like, like motherfuckin' brown sugar sweet potatoes (are you ready?)
Or somethin'
Ha-ha
The plan was to stick my toe in and
Check the temperature, but
Next thing I know, I'm
I'm drownin'
Appelle-moi si tu te perds
This here for the sunseekers
Run the track
What makes you think
I'm not in love?
How could you know
What's best for us?
Why am I here
Standing alone?
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance, yeah (welcome to the disco)
You're so good to me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it felt good to me, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah, yeah
You're so good to me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it felt so good to me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So, what makes you think (what makes you think)
I'm not in love? (I'm not in love?)
And how could you know (how could you know)
What's best for us, us, us? (What's best for us?)
Why am I here (why am I here)
Standing alone? (Standing alone?)
Because I thought you wanted to dance with me
Honestly, it's all about the timing, yeah (yeah, yeah)
I ain't mean to lead you on, because
Him and I got some things that we're trying
But my energy belongs to you
I want you so bad, but not too fast
It's not your fault, we can't pretend
Because we both in the wrong
So what makes you think
I'm not in love? (Feels so good)
How could you know, know, know
What's best for us?
Why am I here
Standing alone?
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance, yeah (run the track)
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance
I thought you wanted to dance
I thought you wanted to dance
I thought you wanted to dance
I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal
If you say so, like cardio
We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You promised to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well
Twin, I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I
Maybe, maybe (for you)
What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you
So don't forget about me, ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you (only for you, only for you)
So don't forget about me (no) ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you
His daddy fine, I'm fine, what you thought?
Shit, his daddy fine 
Nah his daddy, his momma fine, bitch
What you mean? He got his looks from me
You better tell this ho, this my nigga though
My ride or die, I'd kill a motherfucker over this one right here, nigga
I'd stand in front of a bullet, on God, over this one
My son used to record me beatin' biches ass, facts
I didn't give a fuck
I, I bossed up on teachers, principals, mamas, kids
I didn't give a fu-, am I lying?
Nah, you have no reason to
No, if you fuck with my kids
I'll beat up a kids over my kid, okay?
This little boy used to run, he was scared
I said, "Go get your bitch-ass mama"
I, I would beat your whole family and didn't give a fuck
They used to be like "Tyler, Tyler mama crazy, Tyler mama crazy"
Yup, don't fuck with my kids
Tyler would be like, "Get 'em, mom"
She be like, "No, don't do it"
Tyler would be like "Get em, mom, get 'em"
"No, mom, don't do it"
I'd be like, "Shut yo' ass up"
She cryin' "No"
Niggas is blessed

We writin' shows, man, life is fuckin' beautiful

The only flaw is my fuckin' hair won't grow
It's been like two years and this shit like two inches
Come get lost with me, man, come, come, come see the world
When you, when you really get out there
Call me, I'll be there
And I don't take jets like that, I'm scared to go broke, so
I don't take none of this shit for granted, it's opulence, baby
Hey, Ms. Parker

Lemon in my 'ade, lemon in my ears, call 'em boogers
Rather six feet 'fore I'm ever seen with you niggas (hold up)
Yeah

Ridin' in, double-double R, that's that Cullinan (yeah)
Pullin' in that four hundred grand, I just ordered this (yeah)

Got a E and a B on the back of the CT
I'm done with the 12, got a V16
Uh, say the money comin' in, yeah, that's true
The more money I get, I don't wan' sex you
Can't think about the last time that I text you
It's probably when sidekicks had them belt loops
Sign my John Hancock on a bitch every time I check you
Just like a brand new Lamb', I wreck you, uh
So if it's mine, it's yours, woo, woo, woo
Ride to the dinner tapin'
Out of time and imagine her in the exit
Last year, more than what Google say my net is
I got cheddar with the chef in the tinted exit (like whoa)
Uh, uh, uh
It's the double P, I rock double C
Man, I run them beats like you run in cleats
Man, come to me, you want somethin' to see
This internally flawed, that's a double Vs
What troubles me is you couple me
With these subtle fleas tryna double league
Hornet trapped in the hive
Of a motherfuckin' bumblebee
They just got the closest picture of the fuckin' sun surface, that was us
Got the LaFerrari, park that bitch just for one purpose, catchin' dust
My Secret Service carry mops, you call 'em street sweepers, back you up
Tat' you up then add you up, then give you a cover like Adwoa
If the shit's fake, I don't respect it
It's clickbait and that's distaste like a shit shake
What a difference your wrist make when it's Richard-made
Hungry eyes tend to fixate like a empty stomach for a fish plate
Shit-faced, get this straight, this is truck, wheels, deck, grip tape
Ride to the dinner tapin'
Out of time and imagine her in the exit (why you even talkin' to us?)
Last year, more than what Google say my net is (God damn)
I got cheddar with the chef in the tinted exit
Uh, uh, uh (bitch)
Fuck, yeah
Met you on a Saturday
Knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fucking across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was coming to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested
That would be dumb, if I denied
Long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck
'Cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til morning, vibration was heavy
I wasn't drowning or yawning
That's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same
But you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he's my friend
But if I'm honest, I'm really hoping you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make
All them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, "Bros over hoes", I'm like, "Hmm, nah, hey"
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool hand shake
But whatever, we still could be friends
It still could be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got something we cannot pretend
It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off
They like, "No, no, it's not a end"
It was too late and shit
FaceTiming it ain't 'bout nothing
You laughing, packing your luggage
It's nothing incriminating but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, "Duh, bitch"
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the-
Nah, we never did that
Although I haven't seen him in months
Shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me
So we can kick it
Right in front of his lenses, since nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie
We went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk
Man, that nigga not fucking stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin'
We fronting like, "Ha-ha-ha"
Whenever we "Ha-ha-ha" we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth
I'm just a nigga on the surface, for real
Surface
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
You know, they be fuckin'
Yuh, yuh
Didn't see you a couple weeks
Think he want you away from me
Know y'all argue 'bout if you mad
You met him before you met me
I feel guilty but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control but not as much as I could
I been down for days
You're in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat, knowing you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, "No, I want that"
He left for some days
I cleared out my sched, I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mines
I say that we fled, no you pick a place
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, "Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that"
Seven days wit me
Your nigga like, "Where the fuck you at?"
Dirtying my bakin' pots, tennis at my momma spot
Chauffered in the Rolls
The back entrance at them restaurants
Parks playing chess games, giving wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providing methane
Shopping 'til we dropping, what you copping?
See, the price is not an option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer
But you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link
It's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we're friends
But we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missing in life
I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches
Every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter
If I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling
'Cause we're twinnin' and we're matchin'
You stayed in the car
When I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of that car with you
And talk about who we are
You told me when you're with me it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended
And told me that you didn't wanna hurt him
Why we doing this?
Told me this a awkward situation
And you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him it started problems
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What kinda sweater I'm wearing
What music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever
That's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line
But he got every right to be a little pissed off
He you picked up, y'all got in argument
He got his shit off
My energy like, "Get lost"
Your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he seen me make you smile
That nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, tho
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You asked if I gotta, I asked if you gotta
We tripping on our words
Nobody is lying, Hakuna Matata
We sat in the car and cried for an hour
My shirt look like a shower head got it
We called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was paying for, I took 3 L's
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground
I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city
With no destination back up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagra
Vill right beside me making sure I didn't crash
Or do something heinous
'Cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had
Never again will find it
You're in the wrong, gotta remind you
'Bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it
Talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit
When you're in relationship
And you're 100 with your mate
So don't go actin' like no saint
This a two way street
And shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone
You was lounging in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my momma and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, tho it's not fun
You still got yo nigga and still had yo fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said
We couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like bad perm
We'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach
While our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothing, I kept it real
I told you I loved you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you
Promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah
On God, I love that girl
I'm a sh-, I'm a bad person
Like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have
Just vanish when a certain energy is nearin'
And those feelings got so much gravity
And it's out of your control
It made me realize adults
Don't know what they doing either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt 200 percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life
'Cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in a book
Destination: remote
We done been everywhere
Only thing we ain't traveled
Is time (yo)
The boy record smell like bleach
I can travel where I want
I'm accustomed clearin' customs
It ain't custom, I don't come
Flee the bird to the truck
I scream, "Au revoir, " to the stewardess
Border control asking stupid shit
Stayin' at home, I hate
Runaway love, but I'm no Ludacris
Sippin' on mint tea, take my shoes off
Then we take off, then I snooze off
Until I land where I'm foreign
Then I wake up, wipe the drool off
Got my passport in my weekend
I'ma cool off, get a sweet tan
Loafers filled with beach sand
Recline 'til it's time to peace sign
Fuck all the chains and the cars, get a passport
See the world, open your eyes 'til your back hurt
Niggas get bread and won't leave, shit is backwards
Start with your feet, then a car, then an airport
Get out your bubble gum
Blow up horizons, sun
Sled in the Alps or go tube in Missoula
Or tour in Japan or go scuba in Cuba
Or land in a borough, Jerrod got the brioche
Ciabatta in Como, it matches my peacoat
Oversee the sea, all the things that you could see
Like them languages I speak, out in Paris for a week
Take my nephews out to Nice, they like "Who?" I'm like, "Oui, " ha
We on a safari
Legendary (safari)
World-renowned
Globally recognized
Catch us if you can (baby, we on a safari)

Skateboard named him Bunnyhop, it's Baudelaire or Wolfie, though
The felines named him hour for how long he eat the— (pussy) wait a minute (ugh)

Done politicking with the competition, what's the word? (Yeah)
Put that on my mama, nigga, eight in the process
Nigga tryna tippy-toe through the progress
Tongue-tied when the truth is an object
What's the pros and the cons of this next check?
Wasn't nobody 'round, I was independent
In the 90s, sitting bum with the windows tinted
Heard a bum got a strap in the party
Who the fuck let this n- in the party?
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up (ah)
I was seeing double in the projects
Mad at myself when I put it to the side
Mama had to cater for the coupe that we rode after school on the way to Popeyes
And niggas wanna play both sides
It's a red dot, don't get on the wrong red eye
It's a headshot, Damien Kane, Woo, them guys
Fuck around and bury two of them guys
I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France
I thought that I told you, I need the advance
Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm fucking the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I cannot respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swerving through rumors
Avoiding the trends and ducking the hoes
I'm ducking the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
A bunk on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy-toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writing my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep

I'm not a trending topic, I'm a prophet
I answer to Metatron and Gabriel
Bitch, looking for a better me
I am a legacy, I come from the 70
The Al Green offspring, guns and the melody
The big shot, wrist on cryotherapy
Soon as I press that button
Nigga better get right like the ambulance's coming

The Elohim, the rebirth
Before you get to the Father, you gotta holla at me first, bitch!
Smoking on top fives
Motherfuck that album, fuck that single
Burn that hard drive (burn that shit)

All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry n- from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior came with sheepskin
Still remember when I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me to wait to beat the game, it's all in defense
And never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryna call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah
Oh-oh, I know You won't, I know You won't
I know You won't (oh, yeah)
I know You won't
I know that You look over us
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was up for sale
But I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol Anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, "What do you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, everybody so judgmental
Everybody so judgmental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, it was all so simple
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons stuck on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't
Take what you want
Take everything
Take what you want
Take what you want
Better that I change my number, so you can't explain
Violence in the night, violence in the night
Priors, priors, do you have any priors?
Well, that one time, I'll be honest
I'll be honest, we all liars, let it go
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we going down, guess who's going to jail?
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight
Don't you curse at me on text, why you try to hit the flex?
I hold up, like, "What?" I scroll, I scroll up like, "Next"
Guess who's getting 'exed? Like, next
Guess who's getting 'exed?
You made a choice, that's yo' bad, single life ain't so bad
But we ain't finna go there, something's off, I'll tell you why
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
What a grand plan to sell you out
I could scream and shout, let it out
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we going down, guess who's going to jail tonight?
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight
God in my cell, that's my celly
Made in the image of God, that's a selfie
Pray five times a day, so many felonies
Who gon' post my bail? Lord, help me
Hol' up, Donda, I'm with your baby when I touch back road
Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin' home"
Not me with all of these sins, casting stones
This might be the return of The Throne (Throne)
Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus
You are not in control of my thesis
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces
'Fore you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think pre-cents
I can't be controlled with programs and presets
Reset
On my cell, in my cell tonight
Don't have to see you to touch you
This is what braille look like, it's on sight, woo, woo, woo
If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her, send my mail
We know what Hell look like, still, it's a hell of a life, yikes
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
Guess who's going to jail tonight?
Guess who's going to jail tonight?

Stayin' quiet when they killin' niggas, but you speak loud
When we ride, got opinions comin' from a place of priv'
Sicker than the COVID, how they did him on the ground
Speakin' of the COVID, is it still goin' around?
Oh, won't you tell me 'bout the lootin', what's that really all about?
'Cause they throw away black lives like paper towels
Plus unemployment rate, what, forty million now?
Killed a man in broad day, might never see a trial
We just wanna break chains like slaves in the South

Hello, ladies and gentlemen
(Hit-Boy)
I made the fade famous, the chain famous
QB on my chest match the stainless
Amazing Grace, I'm gracefully aging
Without masonry I made more paper to play with
No rap in my playlist, sold dimes on my day shift (king)
So, can I breathe? Can I walk? Can I speak? Can I talk?
Can I floss without you wanting me outlined in chalk?
Family gossiping, pocket watching him
Jealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in (king)
'Cause you are not a king if you can't come out a thing
That you got yourself in, claiming nobody helping
The stupidest part of Africa produced Blacks that started algebra
Proof, facts, imagine if you knew that as a child, bruh
Nostalgia, how I remember things
Remember crowns, remember kings, they want your reign to cease (king)
You a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely
We're so, "Say less when I speak", y'all estrogen speak
Respected by kings only, address me as chief
Invested in things only a vet would
Only lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps
You mad at my niggas, and any women with any interest with me
You could've made it (you was good), look at all the time wasted
Now you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics
All you had to do was tell the truth, like, fuck all the fake shit
You should want every brother to make it out
But brothers want trophies, they troll for clout
Rappers weird, weird flex, but okay
You ain't as ill as you think, you just okay
You got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, I'm on top
Stop fighting it, yo, stop with the over-righteousness
It's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless
My life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up? (Why me?)
Real kings everywhere, stand up
It come with the game (King's Disease)
As we go through life, one of the big questions about
Things we purchase is- is, what the value of it is
Is it really worth it?
I used to be at The Tunnel twenty deep in a huddle
Razors on us that'll make skin bubble, Moet, we guzzle
Chris Lighty let me in a few times with nines
That's on God, wish you woulda walked by
And bumped me hard or just looked at me wrong
My chain on, try to book me, you gone
Goons, Italian leathers, couple bottles of Dom
Took risks, this ain't what you want, there's rules to this
Don't get it misconstrued, my suit game was crisp
Silk, linen, chiffon, Dior to Diadora
But I rock custom more, that hustler aura, tap in
Razor cutter, nineties, eighties lover, raised in gutters
Raised above it, they made it up out the hood subject, I made you love it
Crazy, I knew this chick, she had a blue Benz
A Jersey penthouse, she used to pimp girls that would turn rich men out
Her coke habits was so savage
She hear voices and see ghosts on the average
Of her stepdad, he raised her from a carriage
She was twelve when he passed, she's been in hell since that
Her grandma raised her, I met her in Kingston, Jamaica
Where veteran kingpins bought acres, rest in peace Louie Rankin
Original Don Dada
Man a Jamaican rude bwoy
Uno waan ramp with bomboclaat me
Come, come on
I murder people fi fun
Murder uno bomboclaat fi fun
Peace signs in the air for son
Put his name on the street sign there where he from
Whenever we hear his bangers, flare up a blunt
And praise God, and pray we all prepared when He come for us
Just opened my new office, West Coast branch
Place my teacup on the saucer, it's Esco, man
Bossed up, nothing feels better than doing deals with my brothers
It's surreal, how I feel, y'all should love us
Life is a test so congratulations to your success
For having patience, you deserve the best
You know they do niggas, the IRS
People I ain't even met take it out my check
They the biggest gangster, I respect the jooks
We buyin' big boy mansions, they respect the crooks
This for my project niggas and blue Benzes
Mercedes emblems with they bitch with 'em
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, la, da-da, da (Big Queens, NYC)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, la, da-da, da
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (uh), la, oh, oh, ooh
Ooh-ooh (yeah), oh, ooh-ooh (Hit-Boy)
They called me "Babyface" in '88
On 40th and Broadway they made me stay and wait
Cab service, car 85
Ten minutes, they back in the car
Not safe to drive, narcos are lookin' (woop, woop, woop)
No secret compartments in the ride, so keep pushin'
We get stopped, hide it between the seat cushion
Either that, or just tuck it inside your boot
Don't throw it out the window yet, son, that's all our loot (not yet)
See? They turned
They wasn't after us, my nigga with me laughin' (yeah)
He clutchin' his gold Lazarus
Made it home and he baggin' up (what up?)
I'm just a lil' nigga smokin' weed (fried)
I'm just tryna figure out who to be (Nas)
Horse and Dula touchin' paper (uh-huh)
Plus, Spud and Wallet Head, a lot of bread
And I was talkin' to Tia
I went to her block, I was just happy to see her (what's up Tia?)
And low was how she did me (ooh)
She moved from Queens to Co-Op City (ooh-wee)
She said, "Visit me, that's if you really miss me" (I did), show proof
Ten niggas outside her buildin', that's what I go through (damn)
1989, my baby mind was advancin' (yeah)
Nike Air Trainer 3's, two fingers on her hand, son (ooh)
I'm losin' her slowly (uh)
Plus my other girl is startin' to move on the homie
Hop in 85, roll with me (oh-oh)
When I used to slide
I used to call car 85
Don't want no other driver on the job (nah)
Only car 85
Yo, take me uptown to that smoke shop I like (ooh)
Car 85
All blacked out tint (running for my life)
Everywhere we went, we took car 85 (yeah, yeah)
We gon' ride
Put that tape on I like
You know that tape I like, turn that shit up (oh, yeah)
We gon' smoke and ride (ooh-ooh)
Go to Times Square, we take it from there
Just ride (ridin' with car 85)
It's Friday
It woulda been a good night to pick up shorty
But she on some other shit (ooh-wee, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah)
In my peripheral view
Nothin' trivial 'bout me, just witness the truth, I'm certified
That's been verified
My mere presence got other guys terrified (woah, ooh)
Slap oxygen out your esophagus (ooh-ooh)
I survived with stick up kids, was droppin' shit (ooh-ooh)
The rotten apple's the tabernacle
That's NY, White Castles at midnight
Fish sandwiches, 40 ounces and fistfights (oh, ooh-wee)
They even used car 85 to pull robberies
Use 'em as a getaway car and paid him properly
Next year the whole town strung out
Swept the block where they hung out
Look how far we've come now (Amen)
Grab the duffel and run out
Seven fiends in one house, hustle sun up to sundown
What up? Summertime in NY
In the back seat of car 85 (oh-oh, oh)
The whole hood was tryna call car 85
Any car like that, any number that had that system
Or that cool ride (yeah)
You know that'd make your whole day
Just bein' able to get up and go
To this day, I just like to ride
Lot of thoughts come to mind (ooh-wee, oh, oh, ooh)

(Sometimes) If I could've chose, subsidized housin'
Sometimes witnessin' the most foulest things would arouse us
We became numb like pure 'caine on the tongue
To the pains from economical strains
Diabolical games put on our future kings
And our future queens, y'all the strongest ones (yeah)
May God gives strength to women who lost their sons

I give all I have 'til the war is won
I was servin' out my mama crib, she ain't know about it (she ain't know about it)
Complaining about my rent, but I know my mama got me (my mama got me)
She told me to be a man, and never sleep through problems (sleep through problems)
University of the streets, I ain't plan on going to college (oh yeah)
Why you crying 'bout low income and welfare? (Ooh)
You ain't the only one going through it, this everywhere
Better hold your head, I know it don't feel fair
Reason my people dead and they know I still care
Depending on the people, then you gotta do better
Black lives matter, I'm for real, it do matter (for real, it do matter)
Black-on-black crime, they still do it to whoever (whoever)
Talking to the trenches, we just gotta do better (do better)
He think he Martin Luther, but he tryna be a shooter (tryna be a shooter)
Got his car took, he ride with guns in the Uber (in the Uber)

To all the ones I loved across the world, uh-huh
It was all good 'til it went bad (Hit-Boy)
It's all bad
It was all good 'til she went bad
Damn, I hate to take a loss
Damn, it hurts to take a loss (she went bad on me, y'all)
It's all bad
It's all good 'til it's all bad
Damn, I hate to take a loss (she went bad on me, y'all)
Damn, it hurts to take a loss
Time passes by, I'm asking, "Why?"
You match my fly, no cap, no lie
Trophy, arm candy, but I'm better without it
It's a dub, my love, but I gotta reroute it
It's a lottery, it's loaded, hope I can see all the motives
Before she make a fool out of me, I should know 'cause I'm older
Wasn't meant for me, fuck it, we ain't agree on no subject
We look good together when we was out in the public
You used to brighten my day, had me hype as a kid
First, good morning, good night, now she leave me on read
I'm disappointed, it's different chicks who want it
Can't lie, for a minute, I was sick to my stomach
You need to stop, breathe, think
Before you say the wrong thing
And I wish I could stay the night
But I feel some type of way about it
I've been stayin' up late
Thinking about this day (yeah)
And I wish I could stay the night
But I feel some type of way about it, aw yeah
And it's all bad (all bad, all bad)
I might have to just fall back, fall back
Damn, I hate to take a loss (man, I hate to take a loss)
Damn, it hurts to take a loss
It's all bad (all bad, mmh)
You got some problems that I just can't solve, no, no, no
Damn, I hate to take a loss
Damn, it hurts to take a loss (take a loss)
I don't love you, girl, that's far from true
Even took you to the barbecue
That should show how I much I fuck with you
I know I gotta make the choice, shit is overdue
I had to let you off, might have to take a loss
I might have to take a loss, take a loss
I kinda like it when I'm far from you lately
I'm kinda fed up with the bullshit you do
You need to stop, breathe, think
Before you say the wrong thing
And I wish I could stay the night
But I feel some type of way about it
I've been stayin' up late
Thinking about this day (yeah)
And I wish I could stay the night
But I feel some type of way about it, aw yeah
Yeah, since Guess was spotted on my denim pockets
And my wave grease would amaze geeks and freeze fly chicks
Where they stood, I never lost the steps, stay splashin'
Not one of these just got money, not knowin' how to act
New to these bad ones, I was on fly chicks since junior high
Beautiful fly girls caught my eye
Takin' down some of the girls Drake and Future took down
But I got no time for juveniles throwing tantrums
Texting me that they hate my one-word answers
Here's two, call me, this is you stalling
Guess you through, you ignore me, days go by
Missing you be the worst, play the game, who gon' hit who first
Checking my Yachtmaster, Pac blaster
Wonder why they call you bitch, empty shot glasses
Scrolling back on the thread, the nice things you once said
Look at us now, it's all bad
Aw yeah, and it's all bad
You know I might have to just fall back, fall back
Damn, I hate to take a loss (man, I hate to take a loss)
Damn, it hurts to take a loss (oh)
It's all bad (all bad, all bad)
You got some problems, I can't solve 'em all, uh, uh, uh
Damn, I hate to take a loss (man, I hate to take a loss)
Damn, it hurts to take a loss
Damn, I love it when you talk to me crazy
But who the fuck you think you talking to?
Yes
Something new from my man Nas
This the world famous Brucie B
We call this one "The Definition", haha
It's that vibe
Get your groove on, step, clean, ya know what I mean?
All the way from Queensbridge, my man Nas
Something new, here we go (Hit-Boy)
Yo, see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
Traffickers, African Latin, wire tappings
Here come the people, run my people, they don't treat us equal
I'm talking the law for me, freedom is illegal
Tape telephone conversations, what kind of nation
Got three hundred million people they investigating?
I know they're tryna watch me, a Russian oligarchy
Politically, it's principle they try to stop me
Powerful people establish you, they try to mute you
Unethical ways put you in prison, try to roof you
Our youth is dead to us, they call us stupid predators
Stupid words from the President's mouth, where are his editors?
Antarctica is 65 degrees
Global warming, they don't wanna believe
And they're hanging people on trees
And what the fuck is up with Gale King?
A black male, a female thing, a failed thing
Journalism or internalism
Shirley Chisolm wouldn't play the victim
Eartha Kitt woulda been finished with him
Top of the charts, guarded my heart, playing my part
Sun rising but they want us to stay in the dark
Scorned woman wanna slump me, to fade me to dark
King's disease, I cure this shit with my art
The definition of King's Disease
Well, also known as rich man disease
You ain't gotta be rich to get it
Just doing too much, you'll get it
Gout, uric acid levels up high
Get you some lemongrass
Some cherries, alkaline water
Haha
Tell a friend to tell a friend
My man Nas
It's the world famous
Ayo, Hit-Boy, man
I need to roll up some of that fronto you got, man
I be seeing you smoking
Yo, how that I.E. weather?
Uh
Tilted brim like Goldie talking
Pryor listening, my prior women had no remorse
When they tried to end on no discourse, no discussion
I'm all alone and all the people with the big hats on went home
So what you gon' do now, Goldie? Your bottom left you
It's up to me and you, Goldie, through introspection
You ain't Goldie, you Nas, and my heart ain't cold as it was
And I go through multiple love triangles over and over enough
I talk to my boxing trainer, he's my logic explainer
Conversations through our combination
He told me, "Stick and move, " and "Different rules apply to different women"
Some women's into licking women
Some women's independent, some women want brothers who educated
Some women want Benz's, leather seats that are perforated
Some do malevolent snake shit
Yeah, you can miss me with that fake shit (peace, king)
Dialogue superb, flyest cars on the curb, word
When I evolved, a higher God emerged reserved
More subtle, come from the stress and the struggle
Young then, obsessed in the bubble about it
Took advantage if a woman allowed it
One of the foulest, some would say I was childish, money driven
Mischievous, I perceived it as livin', gifts and ribbons
Any kisses on the lips was forbidden, I was on it
She curvy, then shorty was cornered, no worries
For the naughty, it was higher performance, or was it really?
The games that I was playin' was silly
Similar to them days when I was packin' that milly, it could've killed me
Caution never crossing my mind, she calling crying
Me, I'm more concerned why she ain't falling in line, was buggin'
Grew a lot since they said I was stubborn
Guess it's real, even players need lovin'
When you enamored by female companions, there's no standards
Once you hit and it switch the dynamics, that's the damage
Reflecting on first impressions, what's she expecting?
Why when men don't follow directions, it's deception?
I was intrigued by fine women, I realized
Some were drop dead gorgeous living a lie
Oblivious to beauty inside truly defines
Will you walk with me or are you there for the ride?
For better or worse, every blessing and curse
Understand exotic sands come after the dirt
I was dealing since adolescent
Thinking my girl was my possession
I stand corrected
It takes understanding and affection
Time is money, I need growth for my investment
I don't like attention unless it's a woman
With majestic grace like an empress in Essence
Let's just chill, catch vibes in the grill
Celebratin', many of us never made it (haha)
Whatever brings you down won't elevate you (uh)
Like a real one beside you is very gracious
I'll Na Na top five, nigga, dead or alive
Nigga or bitch, Firm mafioso shit
Ayo, Esco, name a bitch fuckin' with me
Did a bullet, came home, Brooklyn gave me the key
No cap though, facts though, nigga, that's really rap, though
Like really though, my nigga, she really back though
Like really though, my nigga, she really rap though
In my lowski lotion, nigga
Got my wooskies locin', nigga
Comme de Garçons loafers on my posters, Firm la familia
First lady, nigga, Bonnie for real
Pussy power like Tasha pushed Tommy to kill, uh
Black Sheba, Philipp Plein on a sneaker
Lowering the two-seater, bitch, I spits ether
I'm saying my salaams, what up?
Got my three gods with me, so ladies, keep it a buck
La familia
Life (life)
Everything comes back around full circle (yup)
(Miss me with that)
What up, Hit-Boy? One of my favorites (ooh)
Yeah, you know what the fuck this is (what it is?)
King shit, Firm Biz
Mastered this, no alternative
Classic shit, that's affirmative
Ha, got me out here on my first degree murder shit
Stretch marks from this art, gave birth to this
And I stand by every word of this
Malcolm X with a check, close curtains, bitch
Yeah
America the beautiful, gangsta's paradise
For a black man to be rich, you say we sacrifice our own family members
Like we're not savvy enough to make outstanding figures
And ain't nobody in no cult
I give so much, financially give away
But there's an aspect of that that's crippling to us today
Still coping and dealing with my environment as a kid
I trust no one today because what someone in my past did
King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldomly shown
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started sayin' "Peace King" on my song "The Flyest"
And after that, it took off like fire, peace, King
Take it from a street dude, you don't need to be a street dude
Get a lawyer, read your contract, and eat food
Become a Bird, a Flack, a Lionel
When you catch flack, that mean they got they eye on you
Produce great results, they start to lie on you
Is it love for a Queens dude in Supreme shoes
Or did the street code expire with these dudes?
Especially now, I don't expect you to bow, but stand
Creating jobs, named my venture from after the land
I came from, that's unheard of
A hood that's known for murder now doing mergers
The streets is a lie, don't believe these dudes, jail or death is all you get
They tell you never move, but when they get money, they split
King, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldomly shown
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started saying "Peace King" on my song "The Flyest" (peace, king)
And after that, it took off like fire
They hardly happy for you, keep doing what you do
You can't please everybody, and not everybody is you
Don't try to force a square peg in a round circle, that shit'll hurt you
Don't try to fit in either, you're better off with neither
Few veteran speakers get medicine when you need it
Especially when we all need knowledge instead of sneakers
Stop hangin' on to childhood trauma, it defeats us
Our challenge is holding ourselves back, I hope you felt that
Queen, gotta learn to let it go and move forward
King, you should learn to say no, keep all your dough in
King, Michael Jordan gives back and you didn't know it
Like LeBron does, but it's just seldomly shown
King, get ten points from one bird doin' your thing
King, 'til one of your homies decide to sing
King, I started saying "Peace King" on my song "The Flyest"
And after that, it took off like fire, peace, King
Too many changes, you changed from your greatness
Become a byproduct of yourself all for the paper regardless
The markets see you as a old-ass artist
The McCartneys live past the Lennons, but Lennon's the hardest
Stay on your path, stay on your craft
They just want you to switch your lanes up
So they can hate on your ass
What's in a name? What's in a name? Suffering and pain
Guts, blood, and tears, aim straight, game face, king's grace
I came in this thinkin' you was gon' be this great thing
'Cause I seen the greats do it with a great queen
What these kings have in common? They had women who solid
Malcolm needed Betty, I met some queens who wasn't ready
They envy the unhappiness of the greats
They don't have a fulfilled life yet, so they searchin' for ways
To feel what Sam felt, play the hand Marvin was dealt
A Vandross, here's the cure, the antidote
A thousand milligrams, make sure you don't overdose
Turned to a businessman, used to serve 'em in the cold
Cold game, don't get exposed, stories get told
You glamorize the game, it ain't a glorious road
Rest in peace Kobe and Nip, that's off the rip
King shit, if it ain't about fam, it don't mean shit
The cure, love all the allure
Donuts rotten, the phone tapped, tappin' in with Lord
Roll the credits
Cuban link QB chain belong in the MOMA
So boomerang, you salute my 27 summers
Rolls-Royce Brigade just 'cause it go with the moment
Pac's on the chain, got his medallion, I won't
Insinuate imitation 'cause I copied his stomach
Kings honor kings, straight from my pops to my son's shit
Steak tartare bloody, mercury levels from raw fish
Sushi for lunch, waiter at the table, the cork twist
I'm studied like a book by many
They give me looks of envy, I took the Bentley
White chick like Liz Taylor might get the Bentayga
On my Rick James behavior
Life is school for the soul and I'm in life seven already
Life's simple but heavy, incomprehensible shit
Everything from sexy to deadly, I done been through that shit
Still goin' deeper like I grew a new inch on my dick
We looked at robbin' as a way of resolving our problems
My moms cooked food, but some of my niggas was starving
And whatever they was down to do, I was with 'em regardless
Turns out I was hungry and was hittin' the hardest
The scissor was sharper, my predictions was on it
No fortune teller, just going off regular signs
Niggas often tell you they moves
Without a word, just reading they mind
Wasn't needin' no nine
Corner executive born in ghetto hell
Where metal yell especially over necklaces
Life lessons is karma
Whatever you dish out come back as blessings or to haunt ya
Could miss your kids and hit your grandkids for your dishonor
That's generational curses, they said they want the old Nas back
Play the Clue tapes for old verses
Messin' my homies' lives up, sayin' Nas will rise 'em up
Like they wasn't live enough, many lives I've touched
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
I need a witness, drinkin' three at night on some Bridge shit
Wearin' shorts and Timbs, summer night on some Bridge shit
Party with gangsters, gettin' right on some Bridge shit (Yeah)
Like MC Shan and Marley, I be on some Bridge shit
Yeah
Like Jabari, I'm on some Bridge shit
Shooter live on
Kings live forever
Yeah
We go through a lot
And nobody wanna hear about what we go through
And that's cool too
Every man go through the same Mondays and Fridays
Same sun, moon, and stars
It's just how you stand like a man
Pricey
(Hit-Boy)
Boss shit, your Lordship
Niggas talkin' yachts and some more shit
I used to run the block, now I'm corporate (corporate)
Hoppin' out, you know it's Son when the doors lift
Whole squad hide the burners (whole squad)
Mets hats in the sky like Bobby Shmurda
They watch me like a chip', courtside at The Rucker
Flow only getting tougher, she beggin' me to cuff her
Brooklyn Sweet Chick, waffles with raspberry butter
Wear a mink at the roller rink middle of the summer
If I can't get it done, I got soldiers with me to cover
Queens get the money, we only stackin' it upwards
G's stay icy 'cause shit get spicy
She on Demon Time, I get her a timepiece
Patek, niggas not lit, not like me

Fast money, push to start money
Large money, Escobar money (uh)
Little advice (little advice), always add spice (uh)
Always get the liquor with the ice (not me)

My drill niggas out in Brooklyn and they spinnin' and shit
Bumpin' Pop out the whip while we sippin' and shit (movie)
Model bitches that's precise, fuck attendants off the flights
Keep the vision through the lights, never blinded by the hype
Keep the Tommy near the belly, sincere 'cause I'm hype
Got a ghetto Naomi Campbell, designer with the Nikes
I'm the one talkin' spice, twelve year old killers
With the guns and the knives, better run for your life
Got a queen in Queens and my ex a Puerto Rican spice
My Harlem bitch doin' time, gettin' caught up with the swipes

But that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn
But it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double
Check the details
Gotta cross my T's and dot my
I's or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the
Day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin' battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve
It was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look
I was riding 'round in the V-12

Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it
They'll send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin'
Court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Sip Dior with the flowers
Five gold cubans
Champagne while I shop
Hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month
Both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin'
After banging all them years?
Grammy nominated
In the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and
I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know

Bleed music, invest, enterprise
Take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Just like money know money, nigga
Shooters respect other shooters
We was both
Don't want my crew on your neck

But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats
How much money you got? (A lot)

Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six and a half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (hmm)
I never say anything (nah)
Everybody got they thing (true)
Some niggas make millions
Other niggas make memes (hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I was never one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself
But the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot, " I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission cementin' the spot as the greatest who did it
Before it all ends, nigga
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)

exactly what you run from, you end up chasing
(Say it, say it) like, you can't avoid, but 
(Hey hey) just chasing it and just like trying (say it, say it)
Giving it everything that you can, there's always an obstacle
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
To make you love me (secrets)
Oh, you spin my head around (oh, you spin my head around)
I've been lookin' for it (for it, for it)
I've been runnin' out of spells
To make you love me
(Secrets)
Keep it up
To make you love me
I wade in your water (wade in your water)
Your waves wash over me
I drift to the deep end
Don't save, don't save, don't save
It's a low tide (I'll be fine)
I found peace in drownin'
Runnin' out of time, runnin out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time, to make you love me
Livin' in pretend
Keep it a buck fifty fuck
Are you livin' in pretend?
Are you-
So take your mask off
I need her out the picture (wade in your water)
Take your mask off (yeah)
Stop lyin' for these niggas
Stop lyin' to yourself
I know the real you
(Don't save, don't save, don't save)
Halloween ain't for a minute, lose the costume
You need to chill, okay
We runnin' from the targets and 'em back in the day
And now they workin' their all, another track at the DAW
Actin' a fool, actin' a ball, we packin' the park, yeah
But I'm still runnin'
Out of time
runnin' outta
(Of time) still runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta time (time)
Yea
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She′s really fuckin' up my frame
She′s not developed like we are
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I ain′t sharin′
This 60/40 isn't workin′
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine
Please don′t leave me now
Please don't leave me now (don′t leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (don′t leave)
Please don′t leave me now (like magic, like magic, like magic, gone, don't leave)

Please don't leave me now (like magic, like magic, like magic, gone, don′t leave)
Please don't leave me now (new magic, new magic, woo! New magic wand)
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (don′t leave)
You wanna give me mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand
We can finally be together
Roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner′s luck? You′re not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one? Evaporate, we celebrate
You're under oath, now pick a side, and if you don′t
I'll pick you both (run, run, run, run)
(Run, run, run, run)
It′s not a joke, murder she wrote
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea that one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin′ to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I've got a plan, but the walking depends
If you can understand, I′m a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain′t talkin' to them
Can′t be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain′t got no shame
Blow the whole spot up 'cause I ain′t-
I want to share last names, I want to be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin, spillin' feelin′s, now I′m out here moppin' ′em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for mask, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wand
No, don't shoot me down (yeah)
No, don't shoot me down (okay)

Take your hoodie off, why you hide your face from me?
Make your fuckin' mind up, I am sick of waitin' patiently
How come you the best to me? I know you the worst for me
Boy, you sweet as sugar, diabetic to the first degree
My spidey sensies, got me on the fencies
Whole squad in Ginza, travel bag by Balenci'
Big dawg hittin' big wheelies on the six speed

'Cause this parka is Comme, you're my favorite garçon
Don't leave, stay right here, yeah, I want you right near (you started with a mere hello)
You invited me to breakfast, why the fuck your ex here?
Well, let's see if you 'round the God around this time next year
No, don't shoot me down

No, don't shoot me down

I like you on my side 
At all times
Keep me safe (No, don't shoot me down)
Wait, wait, depending on, you know (all the time)
You could be dangerous to me (time, time)
Or anyone else
Look, they be bringin' us up (you started with a mere hello)
Yeah, like now and again
Give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout, I see you as a ten
I'ma leave it at that, I'ma leave us as friends
'Cause the irony is I don't wanna see you again
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
Stay the fuck away from me
I ain't gon' repeat myself, but stay the fuck away from me
No, don't shoot me down
(You started with a mere hello)
(A boy is a gun)
Ayo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle, drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want for me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list
See, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?) I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?) You control me
(Did I wait too long?) I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?) I don't know me
'Cause I'm your puppet (puppet, oh)
You control me (puppet, control me)
I'm your puppet (puppet)
I don't know
I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)
You control me
(Puppet, oh)
You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me (oh)
Aye, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see (oh)
A-Z, come son, I'm gonna take a breathe
Run a 'thon, I just stopped and I'ma take a breathe
You got me by a string, oh lawd
breathe on the song
(La, la, la) breathe on the song
(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la-la) breathe on the song
(Cut me loose)
But at some point, you come to your senses
Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see there's someone in the crack right by the sea shore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cop says my name, bitch, I'm Igor
Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?
Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh

Running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck
Yo, ayo, uh, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?
Whoop, uh-huh
Yeah, bitch

Um, I see the light

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, I can't laugh at ya (I see the light)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga Steve Irwin (I see the light)
Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)
I see the light
I see the light (don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck, don't touch, don't-)
I see the light (don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck, don't touch, don't-)
I see the light
That car crash couldn't take me
Green haired angels all around me, uh
No answers why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive, ah (um, I see the-)
That wasn't my endpoint, like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death (yuh, I see the-)
New album, no repeat, I reset (huh? Huh?)
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the
Light (ee-ee)
I see the light (woo)
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the booth into the mirror
Felt like summer 
To my December
Was it my August? 
Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, it's so comedic
At least I had it (uh) 
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone (two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I know love is all I got
I just hope to god she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)
Keep it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (going)
And now I'm scarred for life
My love is gone (gone), my love is gone (gone)
My love is gone (it's gone), my love is gone
Ayo, there's poison in that gumbo
Emotion for Dumbo
Ask me where my luck go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesser talk, see the
Weatherman told me it wasn't raining
My stupid ass brought an umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and feel better
Now it's ninety degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and illusion because I jet to conclusion
You got your thing, I got nothing, but memories
I know your secrets, nigga
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood her fluent
She opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my building got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
Lemme do it over
(Where? Everything)
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I will never want to fall in love again
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh
But I don't ever want to fall in love again
I said go, go
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I will never want to fall in love again (again)
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh
But I don't ever want to fall in love again
Again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again
(Got my eye)
See, um, heavy feelings for you yeah, yeah, it's no secret
You too cool for me and I ain't tryna freeze up
Like the Johnsons, nonsense, I will speak up
And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up
Like, bitch, I know my shit is bumping, it's eczema
So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um, you do you, I'll do me, I'll just choke the piece up
I ain't tryna keep up, because
I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore
(You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
But this might just be better for us, you know?
Where the time go, I need location
('Cause you don't wanna talk about it, baby)
That's all that I know, I, I, I, I
Where did time go?
What now?
Movin' on, but how?
Uh, somethin' put my feelings in the lost and found
Now I'm stuck forever, and ever, and ever
(And ever, and ever, and ever, and ever)
Forever, and ever, and ever
(And ever, forever, and ever, forever)
I don't love you no more
Tell me where to go
Can I have my heart back? (Heart back)
I don't love you anymore

Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" (bye, later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah
Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend
Are we still friends? (This can't end)
Are we still friends? Are we still friends? (I still wanna say hi)
Are we, are we, are we, are we still friends?
Oh whoa
Can't say goodbye (check it, ahh)
Can't say goodbye, goodbye (woo)
Look, they gave a bitch two options, strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're motherfuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my motherfuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunt on these bitches out of motherfuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor, so I can spit on niggas
Said, "I was just tryna chill and make bangers" (bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (say it)
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast, mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun
(Brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (no)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced (laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitches spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (fear no bitch)
Whole life, been through some fucked up shit (fucked up)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you seen what I've seen, you end up like this (woo)
I walked into the label, "Where the check at?" (Where the check?)
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a badass child (badass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound (blap!)
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten

You know where I'm at
You know where I be
You in the club just to party
I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much
I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck
'Bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes
Don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals"
Bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some Bape
I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face
I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him do what he want
He buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip
When I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street
Know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills
I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me
Their baby father run a bill
Said little bitch, you can't fuck with me
If you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms

Hit the store, I can get 'em both
I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off

If you a pussy you get popped
You a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way
You can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts
Turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip
I bet, you dip, he dip, she dip
I say, I get the money and go
This shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold
Tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls
I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank
No, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know
That none of they niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak
Only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's
Now it's a crib with a Gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know
Just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail
Another check from Mona Scott
Said little bitch, you can't fuck with me

Yeah
Be careful, be careful, be careful with me, uh
Yeah, look
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly, Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'? 
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

Made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt"
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt"
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like
I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli (yeah)
You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready (woo)
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (huh)
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (yeah)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, "You made for this"
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
"#CardiBIsSoProblematic" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash
I'm gigglin', can't let the devil have the last laugh
Ain't no more beefin', I'm just keepin' to myself

You don't like money, I can see it your eye
You don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie
Better be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly
She count money in her sleep and she don't never spend the night
But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin' shit, you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike
God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life
And that guap look like Iyanla 'cause that bag just changed my life
Hey, y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne
But can we please get some more champagne?

Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy
Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete in the Rolls
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life (ayy)

Look don't worry 'bout anything they told you
Remember what she SAID about winter and what the cold do
Everything's a season and some things you gotta go through
Believe me I don' seen it all, you're young talking to the old you
When haters come around look 'em down tell 'em "we don't owe you"
You gon' lose some friends but those circles are better than the ovals
A black man left the Oval
Keep that style you got soulful
The best of the best gon' fear you
Sky's the limit see, I told you
You gon' be the difference between McDonald's, Burger King and Whole Foods
Do your thang and slip thru on 'em they ain't gon' have no clue
You won't need no toll booths, they'll pay attention, Hov do
They'll ask you for advice tell 'em the same thing I told you
Should be a crime to be this fly and awesome
And to think love is all it cost 'em
Feel like Jordan this the ball that Pippen tossed 'em
I'm the underdog and gold is what flossin'
When they told me my chances of losing was higher than divorces
You gotta know your worth and work 'cause I can't force ya
Growing up I shopped at KMart and Ross', celebrated every win
And learned to learn from all my loses
I never signed paperwork without reading the clauses
My parents worked way too hard to not get no credit for it
I'm a trip like Grayson Allen
Y'all never made me VALID
I learn that from Phylicia and Debbie Allen
I'm the other one them another ones screaming like Khaled
We don't match up, ask my stylist
I rock Nike and New Balance
I drink water by gallons, y'all should call me captain
I was told to be the flow and not follow it while y'all actin'
I'm the better version of what you used to think and call talent
I been bankin', check my balance
You a bed away from Skidrow
I owe Sallie Mae but owe my people way mo'
God rested on the seventh day
And worked on me on day fo'
I've been killing for a long time
My lawyers got a caseload
Yeah my lawyers got a caseload
I cracked the code, it's no longer safe for y'all
Kujo still the scariest of all the dogs
After that come all my dawgs
Talent level's thru the walls
I'm the Juggernaut, riding wit my car doh' locked
Coppers known to hang out on these kinda blocks
Don't get shot
They say we 3/5ths human, well the rest of me's an Autobot
I'm really hot
You should ask my team and dem
Jamla's still the squad and my confidence is thru the roof
I appreciate the compliments
Laila's Wisdom, rest in peace, I love you dear
Yo, we good over here, here (here)
We good over here here (here)
Yeah, we good over here here uh
If you wrote me a letter I'll probably make it a kite

Plus make some enemies (enemies)
Invested in you (invested in you)
So, I feel your energy (I feel your energy)
Invested, pursue (ooh, I never read the 48 Laws)
The power of the dussy make a grown man cry
The day I came up out my mama I saw a grown man cry
They say it has magic powers, even Magic ain't die
Wake you up out ya sleep to take a 3 a.m. car ride
He said the booty the only thing between him and God
They love the booty, sacrifice they family and job
Badge make police feel powerful in the hood
Guns make us feel powerful but they don't do no good
I know my blackness powerful and they don't like that
I know some niggas sold theirs, sit back and watch 'em tap dance
Bombs over Baghdad to have a flag to brag bout
Don't make you a big boy, cus you got a nice Stack
Carolina home boy, you know we keep a Stackhouse
Thats power when you know the game, I'm feeling like a Champ now
I went the rap route, homie get out the trap house
I want the power to be able rap bout, what I rap bout
Black child
God, love and textiles
Point, blank decimal
Steph Curry projectile
I saw the goal from 8 miles
With every stone you threw I picked it up and built a powerhouse
Caught a case
I got murder in my profile
Niggas still billin' me
See, that's just the appeal in me
Respek on my name
Why y'all niggas so emotional?
Power
I feel your energy (feel your energy)
It's coming thru (it's coming thru)
Took me a century (a century)
To get next to you (to get next to you)
Plus make some enemies (enemies)
Invested in you (invested in you)
So, I feel your energy (i feel your energy)
Invested, pursue (ooh, I never read the 48 Laws)
Power up with the word
I got it from my God
He said a good shephard don't trip over what they heard
Let em talk the talk until the night you choose to go and purge
I came up when the rest of you struggled and failed to flourish
Conversations with florist
She said I'm good as herbs
Get em high, get em high from the hood to the suburbs
No one can take your power even if a storm occurred
It ain't man made, but whether or not you paid don't help or hurt
It's a perk
Jamla Squad written on my shirt
I got a lane but all the lines around me dotted I can merge
I can do what you can but you can't do the same with words
As I, now watch my street cred go multiply
They say the streets respect a real one
No one's as real as I
It's just me and young blood this where I get all of my power
The night I got a chain from Mr. Flowers
I gave it back when I got done rappin' the same hour
I ain't Five Percent, 'less we talkin the top emcees
And I'm in the top of that the rest beneath me all cowards
When I spit, look around, it's meteor showers
I watch the stars fall, fall, fall, see this what you call Power
Let's talk about Power
Let's talk about your and ours that paid the allowance
Let's talk about hundred-thousand kids ravin' and bouncin
Cravin' and drownin in words the day I pronounced it
Let's talk about Power
Let's talk about do'ers and dont'ers
The house I built when I was homeless and sleepin' in corners
Sharin' Coronas and black and milds
Donuts in el caminos
Talkin' loud, Scrappin' corners
Residue every mornin'
Talk about legacy
Let's talk about the life of celebrity
Verses integrity
Curse the first one that thirst for necessity
Searching for equity
Verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
Verse the verse I wrote in jeopardy
Surfin' the laws of the universe and destiny
Church and a God is the only thing that's ever been 'head of me
Aw! Let's talk about my power the golden showers
Granted to be on your cameras and store counters
He's banana's, competitive, we can dance
Siege the damage, no more fo' he peed his pants
My second LP had real niggas on POTUS lawn
My seven trophies is at my grannys and heaven arms
I'm in Jamaica like wah gwawn my feet is out
My hair is long and patois coming from my mouth
Mi a go outdoors it's time to bless up erryuhn'
Rude boy, me I worry bout it fearless'
I shot niggas then shot movies ten years later
Dear God, why you show me so much favor?
Amongst the haters and wickedness
Deliver this child from evil convictions and frivolous
Debates about who's the prominent emcee of the millennium
And it's all for the Benjamins
And I'm all of y'alls nemesis
And I'm all in all happy none of yall can fathom who Kendrick is
The only one that did wrote book of Genesis
Motherfucker, thats Power
Boys on the block told boys on the spot
You gotta a shot youngin', you ain't gotta get shot
Dangerous to measure a man by the size of his cock
I was told to measure a King by the size of his flock
Who your leader and where y'all going? My army big enough carry a boeing'
Ride off to the Lox
Hair braided, twisted, wind blowin' thru my knots
9th, G, Jones, Khrysis, Amp, Kash, Nottz
Mama got soulfood cooking in the pots
You in a grave situation you should look into a plot
Dirt on my name, boy I'm way too smart
Chest full of a pride don't mean nothin' without heart
One life to live so I gotta make a mark
West side told one thang, don't never rock wit marks
I only rock wit mark, that's my lil brother
That's the big homie, daddy said always keep a G on me
I got the dagger back that thang still sharp
I really play the game y'all commentate behind doors
Don't never say my name cuz it might end yours
I never been lazy but I [eye] seen a plenty Forest
Whitaker, the wit of her, good Lord
Ain't got keys like Khaled but I still open doors
A few in my crew flew the coop
The day I fly the coupe I'll probably get woop woop'd
Speeding thru the laney, what we call high schoolin'
Painted that like Delaney, we see it in color too
Synesthetic, know everybody won't GET it
I'm patient th, I know they'll come to regret
When I ewwww
Pull up in the coupe
When the chrome coming?
It's coming in June
When the chrome coming?
It's coming in June

Spoon feed these niggas
Baby teeth these nigga
Who they teethin' on?
Me, my nigga
Chrome been spinning on my mind
Hair, face new outfit, I'm fine
Trips round the world wit homies we all flyin'
Everything they say ain't gospel, lames lie
Boys always taught don't cry, but need to cry
I was taught to respect the driver more than I do the ride
Ride wit me homie, ain't nothing to hold the wheel
When I was hungry you looked out, you always got me a meal
Workin on my glowup, they askin if I got mills
I got family, I got stress, got success and bills
Good God!
Put 20 inches on the axle
We cop them classic ol' thangs in the Hill like Axel
Lines better than all the rappers aligned if they ask you
Ridin' Shotgun, sittin askew
On the straight narrow
I called up mama up
Told her 'bout my summer reign
She thought 'bout Carl Thomas
I said no no no, no no I more like Giannis
Must be real to get these honors
That's why they put G's on us
I'm Real

You like the way it look? Well baby, it's gon' cost some
Spoiled, look good, she like real leather
She like exotic trips, good weather
All you got to offer is to love her better, better than the rest
I told her, "You ain't need a dime to be better than the best"
Thought it would impress, picked her a bouquet

Borrowed her the car and bring it back on low tank
With his homeboys' homeboys playing 2k

That's why he preying on independent women
Grocery list, and all the bills is paid
He on the family plans, so all the calls is made, yeah

Liquor so dark (dark)

Ah, shit

Ridin'

Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah shit

Dark clouds surround you everywhere you go

You only attract violent, self esteem issue kinda types
Club wit your children, 5th of liquor and skittiwee
Try to run that game on me but baby you shittin' me
Same hemoglobin, family tree, I know you very well
We all got somebody in our family that we can't save from hell
Pressure, pain, memories of bad thangs you been through
Cried so many tears its surprising you ain't mildewed
Look at me
Can't do it
Know that I'ma see through you
Running wit the funny folk
We know they won't see to ya
Loved ones gon ride wit ya
Don't turn your back on me
Truth hurt, I know it do but, please don't lie to me
Good or bad I'm here for ya, that's what you call family
The world going crazy, it's easy lose to your sanity
Looking for a way out, see you beefing wit des rah rahs
Searching for yourself, I see you nightly when you drive by
This nigga, that nigga, don't matter if they holla
You let 'em in, next thing you gotta another baby Dada
Circling, circling, riding, smoking, ya high too
Tryna find the voice that can tell you where to find you
Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah, shit
Why everywhere I go it turn into some shit
Ridin'
She ridin' (where you goin')
Went searching for myself
And I ain't find shit
Ah shit
Everywhere I go it turn into some shit
Brain scattered like showers, I'm losing power
My mind is starting to fuck wit me
Dealing wit lots of feelings, depression becoming publicly
Luckily I'm in line, and be damn if a nigga cuttin' me
Climb a mountain for mo'
No safety, or rush for me
Take a shuttle to space
Space is never enough for me
Peddlin' by the moon they assuming someone abducted me
Judging me by the day, Aliens criticizing
Know why you hate to watch 'cause my timing is hypnotizing
They tell me, shoot for the stars
May need to cop me a rifle
Changing like choir boy on that day he forgot his Bible
Never try to adjust you just fuckin' try to complain
And I try to do not like you, in my view we ain't the same
Monthly collectin' mo' the feelin' how I'm vibin'
Everything for the ones I love got my mind ridin'
Turbulence, hopefully my wings hold
Good wishes and prayers we gon' need those
8:07 PM on the dot
Party 'round the way if you tryna catch a ride
Don't matter what you wear ain't no code for da night
Just hurry up tho, we all tryna slide
Girls in free, boys pay 5
My Back seat full, everybody let's ride
Turn the volume way up high yo, that's jam she spit that "ahhh"
If a cop knock everybody shhh drop
Hide the liquor, we don't wanna get popped

Niggas wanna buck it ain't hot enough for heat
Homie, I know your whole family

Visionary, won't never scared
Never backed down if I was ever dared

Can we just sigh? Can we let go?
Breathe in inside, just let it show
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it
Uh, nobody know nada
We all know the fate of Assata if Cuba don't harbor
Nobody know I'm harder on myself than lonely fathers
Watching Mrs. Parker, these days nobody know who authored
Rhymes of rappers on carpets
Nobody know who real or not
Nobody still know who shot Big and Pac, I'm bothered
Prayed to our fathers for sins I committed summers
Don't nobody know how many but we know our days are numbered
Oh my God
Nobody know the true religion
So why nobody know to show respect and mind your business
I know prison business, but nobody know how many innocent in it
Nobody know that cures cancer been made by the chemist
Nobody know the cost of a dollar worth less to em Kendrick
Nobody smart enough would ever say racism ended
I get winded by the weight of it all
'Cause everybody talkin' shit but don't know nothin' at all
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it
Nobody know I'm scared of personal shit
'Cause everybody judge you, love to change the intent
Internet got no chill, nobody know how it feel to be an artist
Look, nigga this some marvelous shit
Before politics, arguing real vs radio hits
It's all Hip Hop, you can't divide what ain't different
Don't like all underground music, I don't hate all music that isnt
I was just making it clap to Wacka Flacka last Christmas
Clap for a nigga wit her rappin' ass
Nobody know if tomorrow promised live like it's your last
Tell that crush you got you love em, they might love you back
Nobody know if we don't speak up, we don't know the math
Google the name, if nobody know nobody can fill these shoes I'm in
Watch niggas that joke around and say they just playin'
Beatin' me your odds look better bettin' Lt. Dan could walk water
Barefoot, runnin' with Forest chasing a van
If nobody know that this gon' show you that I ain't playin', nigga
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it
If nobody, nobody matters
Why do I bother
But, I thought I had the answer
But, who knows anyway
Nobody, nobody else matter
Who knows anyway
Nobody, nobody matters
Who knows anyway
Who knows anyway (yeah yeah)
Lost soldier wit the bars on the shoulders of my uniform
That makes 'em ask what I do and who I do it for
Musically, I been on my true intelligent of four
That's 12 years a slave, but I'm on year 23 or 4
Been a lyrical grand wizard like Theodore
I'm on the same wave length the sister Rapsody is on
I love it when she get on her Bahamadia jawn
If she wasn't true she would've never gotten me involved
Between the world and me like Ta-Nehisi Coates
Nobody know the artist Mr. Ta-nehisi quotes
Laughin a boars, they grasping at straws to sniff the dope
Pen been engaged for ages we should probably elope
Nobody knows how I shoot for the stars or aim at the moon
Or how I put a band-aid pon a bullet wound
Or, how no matter who you are I'm just as good as you
If not better
Shit, I ain't even sure my mother knew
It hurts, yeah 2014 was the worst year
I lost the only person aware of my worst fear
That's when I shifted up to fifth from first gear
And then I headed back to work and had church there
Oh my God
Nobody nobody (yeah yeah)
Nobody nobody

But I go so hard, make the whole world love me
I remember when y'all used to call me ugly
Isn't it ironic know they all just wanna love me?
So concerned wit my weight I'm mo' Chucky than I am chubby
Confidence of a porn star the day I cut the horns off
Took all my demons threw 'em downhill in a buggy
Then I stood on top the hill and did the milly rock and Dougie
Screamin' "only God can judge me!"
I'm feeling like a missle
Now y'all come around and wanna kiss up to me, wish you knew
All masta's grandchildren fantasize bout crystals
You could neva diss me, I'm more Leo, you more grizzly

The Tesla, the BMI Benzo I ain't picky
Talking appearance ain't no diss to me
No one dissin' me

Still rockin' wit the triple-three
Nine Wonder, my summer feeling like Pete in peace in memory of D&D

Brown-skin persons, all my light-skin persons, we so motherfuckin' beautiful, wow
It's personal, diary, and frankly this game
I'm stylin', my camp concentration, and focus been on a thousand
Black-bottom Jordan's
My soul black as organs
Of chain smokers in churches that sang hymns to organs
Ol' bae, looking for love but I can't reward 'em
Never be the same like what they did to New Orleans
You're never gonna part them
Connected like apartments
Squad thick as thieves, I flip out like cartwheels
Get better like Lamar did
I'm never gonna owe them 
Man versus machine don't underestimate a soldier
D-Block my sister
E-Money my sister
Tia that's my clique I only rock wit real sisters
Snow Hill my home not once did you hear me stutter
But you hung on every single word that I ever uttered
'Cause I don't smoke crack, motherfucker I sell it, uh
Send it through the pipeline, they know who I rep
They know how I rap
They know I don't rest, the system quick to arrest
Uh, if Bobby Brown tell it, I'm the best new edition
Heard ya whispering Tracy Ellis
I'm more than black-ish, this what real-life rap is
My hair don't look natural so they question my blackness
Rachel got over, guess that's a fucked-up standard, uh
Fuck y'all even, fuck y'all odd
How I'm weird 'cause I don't rap bout dumb shit like y'all?
See I'm feel just like BOB, baby, where the love at?
Don't need no more trouble but got beef by the double
That's a different kinda drive-thru
Mano-to-mano, put your fist up for everyone that dissed us
They talk about my lisp more than they put me on the list, whoo
I know shit 'bout him and I know shit 'bout her
But, I don't shit where I sleep, so don't shit on y'all
That ain't in my armor

But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
Papa just copped a Mustang
Lookin' at you like it must sting
Sweatin' me and mine, I bet a dollar your nuts stank
Hoppin' on the left coast learnin' new west slang
Naturally better, versus them, it's like flint to a cup of rain bars
I'm on par with Rocky and Clubber Lang posse
Know I'm possibly the best they ever seen
Yeah, I'm possibly the best you ever seen
Young Gu yellin' I should rippity rap more
I'm known to black out, y'all resemble the Oscars
Flow so much I need life guards
Not like Rikers, them some whole new bars
Influenced by many but I'm a whole new star, yeah
There's levels to this but I'm a whole new floor
They talkin' keys to success but I'm a whole new door
Still slippin' through traffic screamin' that the allure?
I'm breakin' the law, was too much to ever ignore
I been exceedin' the limit since I had an Accord
Always had a need for speed before I met that boy
9th Wonder, I spent the summer bumpin' Wuuuu, nigga (Wuuu, nigga)
Now they like, "Wooo, nigga!" (wooo, nigga)
Been hearin' you for a few, nigga (for a few, nigga)
It's true too many can't fuck with ya
Uh, hope you know the realness in that bar
I know some rappers only nice to me as jesters
Who really just afraid 'cause they know I go that hard
Askin' if so-and-so and I are gon' rap together, yeah
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried about it
There's room in this game, it ain't crowded
Aimin' at the top nowadays, y'all worried 'bout Miley Cyrus
That's a tear in my eye that I ain't cried
It's some paths to a milli homie, you ain't tried
I count ten by fives, I'm always halfway there in my mind
It's on you to catch up this time
'Cause you know

And, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)
But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better

Dropped out of poo-poo weighin' 6-2 with a loose screw
That the doctor couldn't glue, ooh look mama, she said
This world a game, you crack with two commas
When Tutankhamun was Africana, you were a black diamond
Know too many stars turn to comets
We run from the comics until we subjects to the comics
I'm a hero, don't be stressin' the zeroes and the commas
Lookin' anacondas, know they comin' with apples and oranges Satan playin' me, I ain't Adam unless we talkin' 'bout bombin'
Over Baghdad, you look bad tryna to spar with me
I'm a lethal weapon, a saber or a razor, Darth Vader, Al Qaeda
Every friend of Jada, that said it all, I'm a midget at labor
Deliverin' babies the size of raiders, opinions were made
Ultimatums got none so don't come lookin' for favors
I'm tired of you fakers, Carolina, but I still rep the Lakers
Westside, Eastside, every side my tithes good with my neighbors
Double back on my sins and pray one day I'm good with my maker
Tomato, tomato don't apply, you better watch what you say to me
Everythin' ain't okay to me, everybody won't cater me
Though I know I'm a child of destiny, fulfillment is up to me
Up to your neck in debt for every bet you threw up against me
Lord listen, forgive me, I ain't got no sympathy flowers
They say it's better to die with pride than to die as a coward
I say some situations call for our pride to be swallowed
So we live to watch payback come in the form of good karma
'Cause you know
I'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)
And, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)
But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
Yeah
You know I heard what he said right?
Loving you was all I wanna do
My whole life
Rapsody
Please let your brother Busta Rhymes elaborate on this topic a little further
You know the subject of love
Let me get on my Barry White shit real quick
Royal empress queen, damn, I so adore you
There's so many ways to describe this love I've been holdin' for you
I been lookin' for this forever, been searchin' abroad
For that original woman lovin', the nurture to God
The power of your presence speaks even when bein' silent
Universal alignment, I respect your refinement
The focus to blossom this love is my only assignment
I wanna provide and take care of you until we approachin' timing
And when you talk, your words remind me of beautiful speeches
Say to myself, I thank God for these beautiful creatures
Usually deep will be the feelin' every day we meet up
After we fuck, I'ma face you and kick my feet up
The way you hot inside is such a beautiful reminder
The type to make me comfortable puttin' my seed inside her
You're such a rider, love how you're such a fighter
And I wish that I could find a way to multiply her
I'll give it to her gentle, then I emulsify her
And when she asks to have it, I smash it and then we both retire
Put your hand up in the air, girl
Let me shine my light up on you earth while you in here, girl
Damn, you got me swingin', girl
What makes it hotter is mami and God's fan, girl
Yeah baby, you special, you're one of one
If the decision's up to us, we ain't never done
Let's get back to the fun
Some days I wake up and I feel like
I don't know what's wrong and don't care what's right
And I ain't sayin' that's it you
Just saying times I think of myself more than I do you
To give you proper love I gotta love myself some
You gotta find yourself something, get you a hobby or something
During grey spaces we existing in
When we ain't quite a couple but we more than friends
I think about coexisting and how to succeed at it
We gotta give each other space just to breathe a bit
I don't want things to become too routine with us
It's alright, everyday we ain't gotta talk that much
Just knowing I got you in my life enough for me
And you respect me having individuality
That's what makes us happy
That's what keeps us whole
Even in love you gotta keep your soul
Catch me?
Sometimes we just existing and that's alright
Days we ain't unhappy or on cloud nine
Just keepin' up wit traffic riding zoning out
I asked you what's wrong you tell me nothing babe I'm alright
I guess every journey come wit long yellow lights
Slow down is what it's telling me, I'm tellin' me, look
You oughta really listen to the signs you get in life
Tryna follow my own advice
Too many of my friends approaching 30
Upset that they ain't nobody's wife
I know better than to rush hmm
That's suicide
We just starting out
We got a few hills to climb
If you meet me halfway I swear I got the time
To figure it out, why I'm asking for a little some space
'Cause even couples need a couple of minutes for a mental break
So don't trip babe, I'm just tryna breathe, relax
Love ain't easy days gon' come like that
'Cause that's my rollercoaster
My rollercoaster love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Rollercoaster love
Love, love, love
'Cause that's my rollercoaster love
My insecurities don't help at all
There's still love there
Hope he don't stay upset for long
Are we there yet?
On some Ice Cube and Nia Long
Seems we are
Packing his bags about to ribbit on
Ugh huh, fine whatever
Bounce then nigga
Knowing I regret that decision
I'm gon' miss ya
Love funny
It gets cold in the summer and winter
Ya heart just wanna cuddle up
Make up sex wit a nigga, ooh
I promise baby I'm still deep in love wit you
Yep, yep I know the MO, this is how we do
Up and down rollercoaster, too emotional
Got me feeling sick inside
I only like it when we ride
In the bedroom like a coupe, uh
Arguments we loop, uh
Going in circles I wanna circle back wit him, uh
Back when we were friends, yeah them happy days
I really miss my boo boo hoping he don't stay way
'Cause that's my rollercoaster love
My rollercoaster love
And we go
Up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down
Rollercoaster love
Love, love, love love
Love, love Love love
'Cause that's my rollercoaster love
My rollercoaster love
And we go
Up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down
Up and down, up and down
Rollercoaster love
Love, love, love love
Love, love Love love 
Love, love Love love
('Cause that's my rollercoaster love)
And we go
Up and down, oh yeah
Up and down
Rollercoaster love
Love, love, love love
('Cause that's my rollercoaster love)
(My rollercoaster love)
I remember
I remember when
You used to like me
I used to love you
You used to hold me, I remember when
You used to trust me
I used to trust you
Now we don't even like each other anymore
What happened?
We don't even like each other anymore
What happened?
I remember
I don't, I'm tir- I'm really tired of this, man (you used to love me)
I am, I'm, why are we even doing this? (I used to love you)
Hardest thing to do is to break your heart
I know you broke mine and I forgave that part
It's like I woke up one day and I ain't love you no more
Everything you do gets on my nerves a little bit more
I gave you everything I had, I can't give you no more
It's like there's levels to this thing and we ain't on the same floor
And now I feel like Florence, I gotta open the door
And walk through it, I don't know when I got influenced for sure
Maybe mama gave me too much advice for me to keep going
I saw ya mama out she hugged me and kept on going
I know she missed me
Tell her I miss her, for sure
And I'ma always love you forever, ex-boyfriend
Yeah, but I don't love you no more, I mean
I don't love you no more, I'm saying
I don't love you, I don't love you no more, I don't love you no more
Love thy neighbor the bible say
Watching from the window he and homies all congregate
Good lord you fine, uhm that all imma say
Son got my head wrapped up like mama sway, or mama Tate
Come hug my neck, namaste
Wit all due respect, seven sons[suns] like Andre

Every woman needs some affection
Need to be kissed, hugged, told she's loved it cures depression
I talkin bout you, most nights I lay around restless
I only get by day to day by counting my blessing
Tryna get your attention hope see me in these leggings
Know I was raised better
What you fish wit, you catch
I got better bait
That ain't for debate
I still proud of my cake
I got cake cake
Apple bottom looking for a snake
Knowing Imma sin if you ever come up in my place
You my first place
All these other others they a waste
I know a winner when I see him
If you ever round my way
Knock on my door and we can chill and talk about your day
That ain't nothing to do

Fresh out the bed in my slippers, all my niggas is niggas
Brush my teeth while I figure how to get up on these riches
'Cause the Acura's rented and I need something more tinted
Hop in the whip and we been it, I call that whip Betty White
Whole white thing, like money they counting, I see it
Broke as fuck but we dreaming, out the window I'm leaning
Get out the lane, and when I get it ain't gon' change my nigga

I'm a window for homies, I know all of 'em watch
Time and time again reminiscing, remembering blocks
I used to walk around on 'em it's been a while now we back
Gotta speak on the youth to throw all my dreams in the air
My mind a hula hoop going round but got nothing to spare
Nothing to waste, head in the clouds, like I was high on that grape
I'ma pull up in something ignant, I promise just watch
Enough to make momma worry about them profiling cops
But I can't change I was raised by the old ones (oooh)
And when they see me they be like "what you know huh?
Don't forget all your family and where you came from
Money change, the spirit shouldn't change none"
Yeh I know I'm dope, all my homies they do
Malcolm Adekanbi, I'm humble as Gandhi though
Straight out my momma, came out with a Straight Outta Compton flow
I'ma an animal on it with Anderson, I love ya bo
We on that

(Oooeee)
Banging on the can, break it down, break it down, everybody
What they saying now?
(Oooeee)
I'm playing outta your Bron Brons to have you running up the blunts, taking they pom poms
Cheering for me and my team while we eating on Wonton
Squeaking like Miyagi, I shout like the sun
So, who your sponsor? I told 'em I'm a monster like Luke Cage
Take a shot and watch me walk away with just juice stains
Used to tell me "you just wasting your time with them"
Still I come around just to show 'em this confidence like
I bet you feel so high, got your head in the clouds but you still come around like
Ooowee
I see what you started, I know what you promised, you're owning, you're popping like

Was the same back then as you are now, let's hope you stick around, come on
Ooowee
Yeh!

I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
I know I made mistakes
Trying to pray quiet
I gave away my peace
But I know where to find it
I'm going
Going home
I'm going
I spent way too much time tryna fit in
(It's time to go)
Laying on this flo' dying flashing thru my life
And everybody said it's cool but Where dey?
(It's time to go)
Telling me we young and that we only gon live once and this the only way to fully enjoy the party
(Damn near all youuuu... home)
But I was having fun before I ever took the risk now they bangin on my chest telling me it's
(Time to go home)
Thinkin' bout my family, Know this one gon hurt eem honest
Damn I'm sorry mama but I gotta
"It's Time to go home"
Tell grandmama I love her, If you see my baby please hug her
Cuz these demons said I gotta go
(It's time to go)
Save Jordan's for my brother, tell little sister, your daughter, peer pressure is coming
It's real mama
(Damn near all you)
None of it make it cool
But it's her decision to choose
Just remember me when you it's yo time

I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
I know I made mistakes
Trying to pray quiet
I gave away my peace
But I know where to find it
I'm going
Going home

Brought my baby out to play today
(It's time to go)
Thinking when I saw them arguing I knew that won't it good
And so I told her come on baby
(It's time to go)
Now we lying right here dying and it hurts I couldn't save her why they'd have to shoot my baby, God
(Damn near all of you)
Over colors she would color wit tomorrow I know they'll all forget about me and her once it's time to
(Time to go home)
Bout her building blocks just yesterday
(Time to go)
So excited to PLAY but now there's blood soaking our clothes and we ain't have nothing do wit it
(Time to go)
Why they have to trip we were enjoying the day but they had to go and ruin shit
(Damn near all you)
Now we laying on the ground and everything around me fading cuz it's
(Time to go)
I was having fun then mama said its
(Time to go)
Then I heard thang go bang bang- bang bang bang -bang now we lying out here it's time for us

She grabbed me tried run but it was far too late and now we staring at the sun she waiting on me
(Damn near all you)
I hope you don't forget us and that I pray God forgive you when it's your time to go
(Time to go)
Sweet sounds of hellos and I'm so undistracted
I remember winds, and long goodbyes and ashes
I will find my strength at last
My mind captive
I'm going
I'm going home
We was staring at the sun too
We was shooting at each other now we both dying too
I got a family and I know he got a family too
I'm praying to my God and he praying to his too
He fighting for his family and I'm fighting for mine too
Money, oil, land, gold the only plan was to make it back safe with both my feet and hands but
It's time to go home
Well now I'm on my way back going (it's time to go)
They'll give my wife a flag and tell my sons how brave their dad was
And when I make it back home (it's time to go)
I hope they save the letters, pics and now how much I wished
I wish it wasn't time for me to
But know I left wit em on my heart, I ain't want no purple heart
I'm sorry baby but it's time for me (it's time to go)
I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised
I know I made mistakes
Trying to pray quiet
I gave away my peace
But I know where to find it
I'm going
(It's time to go home)
I'm going
(It's time to go home)
I pushed aside the truth
'Cause ain't no days are promised

All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezus said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no pies there
Aye, aye, captain

Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks

My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they've been with toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, told yah
Hold up, get too choked up and I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck is wrong with you? What you thinkin'?

Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third
This is all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
This is all we got
Music all we got, got, got
So we might as well give it all we got
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day
Music all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
Music all we got
We know, we know we got it
Music
We know, we know we got it

There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Say so, got problems, say so
They be like, "There he go!"
Oh, oh, oh, incredible

Everything
Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids
I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys
None of my nigga's ain't had no dad
None of my nigga's ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We still catching lightning bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shawty's act hard
Okay now Dave grandpa grand crossing
First day, nigga's shooting
Summer school get to losing students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer, our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more
Summer friends don't stay
Some friends just stay, stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around
Ooh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Momma had salon doing perms out the armchair
Yeah, we're working late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns for my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way, over time all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessing, now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79, 79, 79 place
79, 79, 79 place
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the clerk
Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends
All my friends, all my
Stick around
Summer friends, summer
(You're my friend)
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around

(So lay your head)
May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when the changing nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when the changing nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends up
You are very special
You're special, too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
You are very special
You're special, too
Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
(Good God)
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up (good God) the blessings come down
When the praises go up
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visit in Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forced you to forfeit it, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, uh!
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle, are you ready?)
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide-eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line

I got a link in my bio, my bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may, Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third drought, third carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop
And you know momma got real worried when she heard college drop
But now I call the shots

Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still cares about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
Bad little mama, she gettin' it Obama

She shine like a Rollie, got that from her momma
Can't see me, can't be me, I'm ridin' like a panda
That booty gon' roll and it's outta control
And these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty
All my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me
Rub me down with that lotion, baby oil me
Drinking Actavis, baby I'm showin' me
In that choppa I see your perimeter
Change the culture, cause my ring is a solar
Wait one minute I told you
Yeah, I would like to know you
Yeah, you lucky like clovers
Yeah, the clothes no good
Mama I do it, your ass I pursue it
Just look at me baby
I came from the sewers
They love all the slime ball

That got me serene like I'm breakin' a bar
And I'm ballin' on you like I'm Chris Paul
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
Am I the only one who really care about cover art
Growing up I ain't have my brother cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After 1Night the folks thought I was finished
I pin my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
Bitch it's Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I said am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't going to hell or the Hillman
Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
So they fuck around, sign me to OVO
Oh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even have Steve giving out apples for free
They was talking "woo woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
Who is you? And who the fuck is you? And who is him?
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me
Na, na, na, na I got angels
I got angels
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, nigga's never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gonna make me take the campers way downtown
You gonna make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 107.5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 107.5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

We used to roll at the rink, we used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister jjuke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry about Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
And realized what booties can do
We gon' get it poppin'

You used to "I remember you" 'cause
We've got so much history, baby (juke), maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke) I'm crazy (juke)
We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hit roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown
I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and your arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating
We've got so much history, baby (that's right, that's right), maybe (that's right, that's right))
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy
Crazy about you
We gon' get it poppin'

And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend

Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say

You should use your phone, call a Uber

The first, is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis
The book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrified
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide
79th, 79th, I don't believe in science
I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs
Color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shorties lie
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like "shhh"
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back, or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently, row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground
We just been smoking a bowl

Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers
So when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So he can watch her lonely child
I know my God
I know my God seen his breaks and his edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days he prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was his love
And all that was left was his love (never)
And all that was left was his love (never)
And all that was left was his love
Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been (never, never, never)
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been (never, never, never)
Never drown
Never, never, never
Chance let me in, c'mon
This thirst in my soul (there's a thirst in my soul it tell me)
Where else can I go? (Where?)
For you (Come on)
I may cry a river (I may cry a thousand tears, but)
But You take each drop and You wash (you wash me new)
Me new (people sing)
This water is deep (yes, yes and I need You to)
Jesus rescue me (come on, save me, I need You to)
Take me to Your mountain (hallelujah)
So someday Chicago will be free (someday we'll all be free)
Be free (say)
The water may be deeper than it's ever been (never, never, never)
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been (never, never, never)
Never drown
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
(Good God)
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up (good God) the blessings come down
When the praises go up
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visit in Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forced you to forfeit it, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, uh!
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle, are you ready?)
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
Every nigga is a star, ay, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ay, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ay
Who will deny that you and I and 
Every nigga is a star?
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your weight, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the prez with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money, go back home
Money, go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money, go back home
Money, go back home
(Everybody get out!)
At first, I did love you (love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (of you)
Until I get my nut ('til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (that's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the baller in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby, count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (it's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (when you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money, go back home
Money, go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money, go back home (tax man comin', tax man comin')
Money, go back home (tax man comin', tax man comin'!)
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway, I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents? Hell fuckin' naw
This dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule, not a forty ounce and a pit bull, bullshit
Matador, matador, had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that? Genital's best friend
This dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty, apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest, matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free
I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
(Aye aye nigga whats happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga)
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all share bars, like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
(A two man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say...
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king
Bitch where was you when I was-
*POP*
(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you)
*POP*
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, (King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master take the chains off me
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit
Life to me like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said
Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
Sex
She just wanna close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls, say hey (hey)
Say hey (hey), (ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (play)
She plays, only when you tell her no
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny, accept it, your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (talk)
I remember you was conflicted
Misusin' your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusin' my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in a hotel room
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
"Housekeeping, housekeeping"
(What I got to do to get to you?)
"¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!"
(To you)
"¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!"
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
"¡Disculpe!"
(What I got to do to get to you?)
(To you)
And you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed," you ain't try
I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk 
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk it'd say, "You gotta go"
And if I told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I
Hard times like, yah!
Bad trips like, yah!
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us then we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, twenty of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come in heaven, no preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you, a house? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs, I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
What's wrong nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?
I thought this what you wanted?
They say if you scared go to church
But remember
He knows the bible too
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know
I remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said where's Ricardo?
You said oh no, not the show
Than you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I don't do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring
Lucy gone fill your pockets
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that's possible"
Get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
Oh shit! I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Yeah, that sloppy
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
(West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back
(West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
I know everything
I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don't gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it's worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn't know shit
The day I came home
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit
I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest in peace then be an advocate
Tell your homies especially to come back home
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind, ah!
You make me wanna jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
(Let's talk about love)
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
(Let's talk about love)
(Let's talk about love)
(Let's talk about love)
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, ah!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyday
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is
K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga?
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga (my nigga)
My lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga (my nigga)
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga (my nigga)
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga (my nigga)
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, "the enemies done cliqued up"
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around
Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
Everybody wanna talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
"K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box"
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo-
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth, trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
Twenty on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
Twenty on six, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand
Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, beat it
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, my son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'
Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal, Kazaam is sad
Thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free"
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God
I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, to right my wrongs
I'm with this
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Ooh, complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love, uh)
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if massa listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Ooh, complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love, uh)
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if massa listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival of mankind
If he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then wit told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with
Complexion (woo, two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Ooh, complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love, uh)
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
Let me talk my Stu Scott, 'scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop
Loving thy color of your skin, color of your eyes
That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby, uh
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin' "Woo-hah!"
Need a paradox for the pair of daughters they tutored
Like two Todds, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see your beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, uh, that's the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain't talkin' Jay, mm-mm, I ain't talkin' Bey
I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self esteem the new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thing
Barefoot babies with no care
Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?
I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to a God)
I want everything black (That we don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, acting a fool
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like:
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
And the world don't respect you
And the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Repetition can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies, bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
This is a world premiere!
This is a world premiere!
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (crazy!)
What you gonna do? (what you gonna do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (haunt you)?
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene, yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Walk my bare feet (walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (down, down valley deep)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (fi-fie-fo-fum) (I love myself)
My heart undone (my heart undone)(I love myself)
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
(I love myself)
But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind
(I love myself)
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin' I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the
First? Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest?
Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting
Your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your X?
Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of
Pit bulls, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the
Continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga"
Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it Another Nigga but, it ain't really a poem,
I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to.
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you,
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--,
About a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground.
What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That's how I see it, my word is bond.
I see--and the ground is the symbol for the poor people,
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the
Rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat,
They gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy,
Appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry,
You know what I'm saying it's gonna be like... there might
Be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich
Aight so let me ask you this then,
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or
Somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural born hustler,
A true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin',
I took the opportunities,
I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so
I could get it to where I owned it.
I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that
Works my management company.
I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years
You know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire.
I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions
For myself, you know what I'm saying.
I made millions for the record companies,
I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us
And through your different avenues of success,
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
And by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true.
" You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason,
You know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit,
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening.
So it's no problem,
You know I mean it's a problem but I'm not
Finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been
Threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance.
And not only me but it goes down my family tree.
You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back
Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like,
We fighting a war,
I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down
In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit
Maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager,
While you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights,
While you still wanna shoot back.
Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of
A man, out of a black man in this country.
And you don't wanna fight no more.
And if you don't believe me you can look around,
You don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas
That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy
You left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil
Goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you
Think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next
Time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real.
I don't think America know that.
I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some
More playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder,
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831,
Up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen
That's crazy man. In my opinion,
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations,
Lotta people don't understand how important it is.
Sometimes I be like,
Get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy
I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes
Because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin',
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you.
It's actually something a good friend
Had wrote describing my world. It says:
"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything
Around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the
Caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the
World shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent,
The thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the
Butterfly as weak and figures out
A way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar
Goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots,
Such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that
The caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are
Completely different, they are one and the same."
What's your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac?
Pac?!
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I
Hard times like, yah!
Bad trips like, yah!
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us then we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, twenty of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come in heaven, no preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you, a house? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs, I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
Sex
She just wanna close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls, say hey (hey)
Say hey (hey), (ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (play)
She plays, only when you tell her no
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries
Gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it
I love it when I'm in it, oh
If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny, accept it, your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (talk)
I remember you was conflicted
Misusin' your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusin' my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in a hotel room
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I
Hard times like, yah!

So I went runnin' for answers
This is a world premiere!
This is a world premiere!
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (crazy!)
What you gonna do? (what you gonna do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (haunt you)?
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene, yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Walk my bare feet (walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (down, down valley deep)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (fi-fie-fo-fum) (I love myself)
My heart undone (my heart undone)(I love myself)
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
(I love myself)
But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind
(I love myself)
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin' I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (ooh)
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is a world premiere!
This is a world premiere!
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (crazy!)
What you gonna do? (what you gonna do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (haunt you)?
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene, yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Walk my bare feet (walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (down, down valley deep)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (fi-fie-fo-fum) (I love myself)
My heart undone (my heart undone)(I love myself)
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
(I love myself)
But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind
(I love myself)
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin' I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive"
"Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go!
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, whoosh
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make
This appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peaked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand
Surprised to see me, cat got your tongue
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat,
You can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it, we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt?
This should be fun
Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M&M
Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place
You could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
Oh, God, police! Ahh!
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged,
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult
That, with the double-standards you
Have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic,
Of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the
Glam, no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so!"
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call you the
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers left off
Don't kill me!
Hurry the fuck up! 
Thank you! 
Go, go, go! What the... fuck? The fuck did he go?
Mothafucka bail on me? Fuck you!
*Car stops working*
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me!
Are you fucking kidding me? Shit! 
Get off! 
Ha-ha! 
Parking lot! Shit, ah!
Let me see your hands, bend over!
Ah, fuck it!
Yea, Yeah
Yea, Yea, Yea
(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
(Your music usually has them)
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts are entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch
But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got,
Don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
Marshall
I don't know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha-ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)
No! If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start
Dancing, even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens, to be rapping, blue lights flashing
Laughing all the way to the bank, lamping in my K-Mart mansion
I'm in the style department with a
Pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent and condescending, the king of nonsense
And controversy is on a,
Beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plea, guilty
Cause I sparked a, revolution, rebel without a cause
Who caused the evolution of rap to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?
Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, cause it's the...
It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done,
Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)
So, yeah, dad let's walk, let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas, I appeal to all those walks
Of like, whoever had strife,
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I, related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle, cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles, yeah, uh-oh
Better beware knuckleheads, the sound of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken, it won't lock,
It might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come pay me a visit,
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite,
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks
Then you wonder why I lash out,
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out
A completely brain dead Rainman, going a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas,
I'm angrier than all eight of the reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryna look for a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a CRIMINAL
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go EMERALD
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing
Is: Dad, I'm back at it again, bitch
You fucking cunt
Pick up the god damn phone
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday? With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there looking for me?
Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lying slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You wanna lose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
"Okay, yeah, and I'm cuckoo eh?" Well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth; Dre, Drake, Lupe, ooh touché
But you're too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true blue ace, but you ain't
And I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late
Go smurf yourself, you make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? (Dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway, tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over but they let me go
'Cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk
'Cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my "fuck hoes", with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same baby, come on
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement
And I am channelin' my anger through every single station it's on
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say he-art
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?
Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I lo-lo-lo-lo lesbian, ah
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life would be so much better if you just
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? (Dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)
'Cause you told me
You'd love me
Forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fucking life
But fuck it, there's other fish in the sea
And I'ma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches, hoe, I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-
Made for me, say "fuck it", kick some shots back, get hammered and nail her
These bitches tryna get attached but they're failin'
To latch onto the tail of my bumper
They're scratching at the back of my trailer like I'm itchin' to get hitched
Yeah, I'm rich as a bitch, but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swinging at these chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls, it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid, wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed
Oi oi oi, man oh man, you boy boy boy's
Getting sick at these girls, girls, girls
Oink, oink, oink
You fucking pigs, all you're good for is doink, doink, doink
I got ninety-nine problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all ninety-nine of 'em I need a machine gun
I take 'em all out (all out), I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just drop dead
And I'ma throw a fucking party after this, 'cause yes
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head (you made me this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? (Dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better (better, better, better)
I'm just playin', bitch, you know I love you
this is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, all, all-all
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Wait is up, hands up like it's twelve noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, all, all-all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top five in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck? I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, zero to sixty hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win
Bitin' the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, all, all-all
So take it all, all, all-all
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool boxes
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to believe
'Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you
Self esteem must be fucking shooting through the roof 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be allergic to failure 'cause every time I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then achieve
This (this) is (is) survival of the fittest
This (this) is (is) do or die
This (this) is (is) the winner takes it all
So take it all, all, all-all
So take it all, all, all-all
Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you (for you, for you, for you)
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a Martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
'Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defiant often
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
So I'm non-compliant at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often, in the corner somewhere, quiet
Trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school, so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
'Cause he said that I eyeballed him
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words
'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything, in my mind small shit
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara then split
But I don't give a shit, I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side, at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Find in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'
They're kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryna escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like "that's right fight's on bitch"
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest
This is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength (strength)
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you whack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit (dog shit)
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground on which I am walking (I am walking)
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole oh and sixteen Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch, I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
'Til I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes (exhaust fumes)
The best part about me, is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the fire Marshall and this is my (this is my)
Legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speakin' to children
Everything was happenin' so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
'Cause I was gettin' sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinkin'
"If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him."
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
'Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like tellin' Gwen Stefani she sold out
'Cause I was tryna leave no doubt
In anyone's mind, one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now because everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!
Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changin' back into that old maniac
In fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
'Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?"
'Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
'Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
'Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
'Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
'Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
'Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuck father time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I'm goin' back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can't knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em, "Stick it"
So sick, I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down and 
(Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and 
(Go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk)
Grab your vial, yeah
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang
Yessiree Bob, I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, ba-wit-da-ba dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow, chicka-bow, chicka-bow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down and 
(Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and 
(Go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk)
Grab your vi-
Everybody
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry, yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And, girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers shithead with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangols and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd ma'am
You birdbrain baby, I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow (ha-ha)
Word, Rick? Word, man you heard, but don't be discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down and 
(Go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and 
(Go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk)
Grab your vial, yeah
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, 'cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, "Fuck it" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk)
Grab your vial, ye-
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "Bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!" That's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "Way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "Hell, yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop, " 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?
Poor Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Eminem, Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper Eminem
Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science can operate on his distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourette's
F-, f-, f- can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little b-, predicaments, despicable
I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freaking wuss, a pu-
This kid just took my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his toosh, but I was six and shook
This f- was 12 and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book, now there's using your head
Mama always said
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
A brain you'd be dangerous
(Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'ma grow a name and be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
(Mama always said)
"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless
Fast-forward some years later, a teenager
This is a fun, sweet! I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud for what reason, you stomped me
But how do you get the sh- beat out of you, be down and be upbeat
When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life
Chance to make it or succeed 'cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street
But if I had just kept my head up my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more, school, this - helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door
Hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored
Ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be Dahmer
'Cause mama always said
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
A brain you'd be dangerous
(Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'ma grow a name and be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
(Mama always said)
"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless
Now my mom goes "womp, womp, womp"
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go, they scream out "Go!"
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out
Middle America, hear them yell out
They were so scared, and those kids
Just about, belted out, whatever spout that it fell out
Of my smart alleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfu- difficult, ch'yea, 'til then
Hopefully you little hom- get over your fears and grow beards
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke qu-
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfu- (insert insult here)
Who the f- would've thunk that one little lone MC
Would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
And boy they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked
This Hip-Hop sh- in his pocket and still the sh- got that white trash traffic and gridlock
Sh- happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid Oc-tober
And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
'Cause I turn into the unabomber
Mama always said
"If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
A brain you'd be dangerous
(Mama could be wrong)
Mama, I'ma grow a name and be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
(Mama always said)
"Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless
Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid -
Neither is ain't
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothing without you and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
Cause I'm stronger than I was
A beautiful face is all that you have
Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby hold me please
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
Cause I'm stronger than I was
You walked out, I almost died, it was almost a homicide
That you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah
On the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I, felt like my, whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda
It's like you put a, knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the, other side
Of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign
Of life in me for the, first time since you left me
And left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda, had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with the chump-ions
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Would've been our anniversary
Two years but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now
So I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me, I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be, I may never trust someone
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
Cause I'm stronger than I was
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (ooh)
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half full
But my tank is half empty, gasket just blew
This always happens, thirty minutes from home
Gotta lay a log cabin, only option I have is McDonald's bathroom
In a public stall, dropping a football
So every time someone walks in the john I get Madden
"Shady, what up?" What? Come on, man, I'm crapping
And you're asking me for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
"Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan"
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him, "Todd, you're the shit" when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causing an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fucking trash
Without someone passing through my sub', harassing
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask, sufferin' succotash
But the antacid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fucking mashed
Potatoes, so what? Ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper-class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me and
(Life's been good to me so far)
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd doing if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd-sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned forty and still sag
Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me?
I leave on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berzerk
My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag
Her nylons ran, her skirt's snagged
And I heard she drag-races, swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (yeah) work, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an encyclopedia Britannica, hell with a Playstation
I'm still on my first man on some from Zelda
Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread
Make a sandwich with Welch's and belch
They say this spray butter's bad for my health, but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford and welfare mentality helps to
Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still cramming the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves
Goddammit to hell, I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day someone got all elaborant
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catching up with me
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me and
(Life's been good to me so far)
Got friends on Facebook, all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked
I'm trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
The show's over, I'm hiding in Kroeger buying groceries
He just had front-row seats, told me to sign this poster
Then insults me, "Wow, up close didn't know you had crow's feet"
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shopping at Costco
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught picking my nose, ah
Look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em stuck at the light
The fucking shit's taking forever to change
It's stuck, these bitches are loving it, rubbing it in
Chuckling, couldn't do nothing, play it off
"What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better, " fucking bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with another one after Recovery
Was so highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snapping fucking pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you push me to the limit, what a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse, I'm living the dream
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me and
(Life's been good to me so far)
Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust, judgement is clouded
Must just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
'Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts, brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo"
'Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario
Though in the first place (ah, fuck)
But you confirmed my low-end theory, though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"No you don't understand, I don't do this for anyone, ever"
Yeah, that ain't what they all say? I'll say
You can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
Lebron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
'Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'
The game of love (love), love (love)
La-la-la-la-la love
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (go where you wanna
Go do whatcha want to do, I don't care)
And I told her (go where you wanna
Go do whatcha want to do, I don't care)
I told that bitch 
"I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick"
Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter, you beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available, now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those expensive heels
You little fucking Ferris Wheel, fucking spinning on me?
Fuck you think? We gon' get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't a fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day" 
Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me? You cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasing her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the
Game of love (love), love (love)
La-la-la-la-la love
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (go where you wanna
Go do whatcha want to do, I don't care)
And I told her (go where you wanna
Go do whatcha want to do, I don't care)
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an instant replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway, simple misunderstanding
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fucking brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fucking tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's laying next to me in bed
Directly aiming a gat at my head, woke up again and jumped up like
"Fuck it, I've had it, I'm checking into rehab"
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, "Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, "Rape" 'til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spelling's face
Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates 
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date, though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly because of the game of
Wait, dinner at eight?
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly 'cause of the
Game of love (love), love (love)
La-la-la-la-la love
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who, what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleanin' Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you 'cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my Ma
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave"
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
'Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, momma, for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
'Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have 'cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, mom, please accept this as a
Tribute, I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, 'cause you're my mom
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life
Yeah
Tryna figure out the difference
But I think, think the lines are starting to get blurred
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
'Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey 
And started slowly roastin' 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes
I'm frustrated 'cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battle, suck a duck
Crawl out the back, it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal
And beware of barstools flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut, but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall" (Palin)
Oh, my bad, slut
And next time I show up to court, I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, "That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you au jus
'Cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic 'cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
(Rape your mother) (Kill your parents)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', "Fuck, shit, fuck"
Adult with a childish like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, "Merits?
Fuck that, I'd rather be loud and I like swearin'"
From the first album even the gals were like, "Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes"
But my fuckin' mouth was nightmareish
And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition (haha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies
This darkness closing in (evil twin)
There it goes again (evil twin)
It controls my pen (my evil twin)
But that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (evil twin)
Who pops up now and again (evil twin)
So don't blame me (evil twin)
Blame him, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
(Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time)
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina
I ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh Ledger
My suicide notes barely legible 
Read the bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy? I'll be Jerry Mathers
I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny
When on the steps, I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap
Used to mop floors, flip burgers and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryna get props for 'em
'Cause I took book smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A. was blarin' through my car windows 
Leaning on the horn, screamin', "Fuck the police" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who do you think that third and that fourth spots for?
And as crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
Please come in, what was your name again?
Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth 
I wish someone'd finally admit me
Into a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho (hey ho)
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"
No, I'm hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8
And I (base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryna hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shockin' image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
'Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxin' critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the "dope"
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every 60 seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Beggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors
'Cause those were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument
'Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fuckin' tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say "Bon appétit!"
'Cause I don't know what to eat
Fuckin' microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
'Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' "Who the fuck passed you the mic?"
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
'Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down!
'Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, 'cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
'Cause I'm hyper or somethin'
Needin' someone or somethin' is lightin'
This fire under me, it's breathin' new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin' nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin' a stroke of genius—Elizabeth, I'm comin' to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't group me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers comin' up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Who's mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein' Indian burned
Hah, bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words
You know I got you open kid, stop frontin'
You know I got you open, Word Life...
One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ouch
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory
Storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat cos' I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god cus' If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
Girl, you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
Uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love (You know this ain't love)
Oh no (Oh, this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh, this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
Wants me to be that guy to her
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
'Cause I give in at the sight of her
And I here I go again
You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are—super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
'Cause this ain't love
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh, this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh, this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
Wants me to be that guy to her
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
'Cause I give in at the sight of her
And I here I go again
Just want you to myself
Don't wanna share you with no one else
"What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally to get the picture"
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? (What?) The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, "The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal
Through the uprights
You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh, this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh, this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
Wants me to be that guy to her
Lord, it's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
'Cause I give in at the sight of her
Desperation (And I here I go again)
What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, b-, and rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them b-
But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it become my new religion
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for something to do, was flippin'
Through radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the The Wizard
You ain't have a f- clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing for shoes
F- them stupid Pumas, b-, it's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Made that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new sh-, he'd go cuckoo ballistic
Go through the roof for his sh-
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this sh-
Never quit, too persistent
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this sh-
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shi-
I got that b- in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen, Slim
It's not budgin' like cinder blocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to p- in
Spot in that top position
Koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's p-
Leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, b-, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, sh-, no wonder you're sore losers
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more drippin' in bird sh-
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement but discouragin' the rappers, the rap game's God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
And you ain't gotta wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served
Bloodthirst, revenge of the nerds, chka
But the dumpy kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into an non-humble Don
You blonde dumb, all I got is d- for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the f- Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a f- yawn
So mow the f- lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm f- up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just make a path and take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood was burnin'
Return of the no good and I won't quit
(And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed)
And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head
I'm a monster, mutt
I'm a monster, mutt
I'm a monster, mutt
I'ma turn into a monster
Monster, mutt
I'm a monster, mutt
With my dick in your mouth all day
(I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing)
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out with the thornbush that ya
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve as you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket
But you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing at inferno and chant
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
You're so familiarized
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
'Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive
Which means you will survive
Although today you may weep 'cause you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and
Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow, you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive 'em, even after all the shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof
Flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'
You look down, 'cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly
And I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Asperger's? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if it's an
Eighty degree day and there's no frickin' air conditioning
And you can't see b- the hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up, blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving an adjective an a- whooping
So bad they should put his a- in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I cut class and ditch it 
Now I bully rap, I'm the sh-, f- (sniff it)
Cadillac from a K Car, my a- from a hole in the ground, still can't tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park screaming
I'm proud to shop at K-Mart, and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle wylin', I don't give a f-, I don't play
B-, you think you saw this basket first?
You're a- backwards like motherf- Bob and Silent Jay
Illest sh- you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape?
Ripped a gaping hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes
Tied 'em around my neck, went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground, splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale
Or being g-, little f-, but by the way
Thoughts are getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a f- miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane
Every rhyme I say sons you like an ultra-violet ray
I'm sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the sh- you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm sh- on competition
In the meantime it's always mean time, I'm getting
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I've been a career asshole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much f- up sh-, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this sh-
I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is d- for days and insults for decades
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a d- 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words, don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause, baby, stable mentally, I ain't, I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these h- shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a f- echo (echo)
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spriralin', here I go
I'm out of control like no other mic go
Stab you to 'til the knife goes, dull
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you
You don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so 
Strike up the f- maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Oh, please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Oh, thank you, God
Ah
Sh-
F-
What the f-
Is that a girl?
Yeah, I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in mouth and get my balls blew out
And get gay into the AM
And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
I wonder who that voice is
Buttf- it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
F- serious?
So everybody, everybody
Jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where you going? 
Come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? F- you then
Blow it out your a-
Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?

This is fucking awesome
Now, walk into the club like, "What up? I got a big cock"
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, "Damn, that's a cold-ass honky"
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (piss)
But shit, it was 99 cents (bag it)
Copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins, someone else's been walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style
I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board (yeah)
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, "Ah, he got the Velcros"
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome, ow
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button
Up shirt, 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (bins)
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (men's)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight"
I'm like, "Yo, that's 50 dollars for a t-shirt"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't
(Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah)
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (damn right)
I look incredible (uh, come on, man)
I'm in this big-ass coat (big ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (let's go, we coming)
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome (hahaha)
You'd take the clothes off my back, and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it, I still don't know why
Why I love you so much, oh
You curse my name
In spite, to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why (don't know why)
Why I love it so much, yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Uh, Blue told me remind you niggas
Uh, fuck that shit y'all talkin' about, I'm the nigga
Uh, caught up in all these lights and cameras
Uh, but look what that shit did to Hammer
Uh, goddammit I like it
Bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mill for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
'Nough to make me wanna murder, mama please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Know we all just entertainers
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sittin' low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit just ain't work, this light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours, why you mad take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water you're still alive
Still that nigga nigga, you survived
Still getting bigger nigga living the life
Vanilla wafers in a villa, illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack the code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
You get the air out my lungs, whenever you need it
And you take, the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleeding, I still don't know why (don't know why)
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And you play this game, in spite, to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink, with guess whose name
But I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail
Don't know why

I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
Hahaha
Is that your grandma's coat?
I hope that God decides to talk through him
That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork, cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums
Let the snare knock the air right outta your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Amen, regardless I'ma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
'Bout damn time that I got out of my basement
'Bout damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours
I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell
David-Bowie-meets-Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today, all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day, I'ma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him
Celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage
I'm actually working on leaving, see
I observed Escher, I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Haring, you see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great because they'd paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No Child Left Behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system
What you expect?
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in, and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it
No light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart, no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever, man what is up with you?
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth
It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted a encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave
Part of the show, it all fades away
Lights go to black, band leaves the stage
You wanted a encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Hey, hey, hey
Good to see you
Come on, dude, let's go
Yeah! Let's go!
Ha-ha-ha-ha alright
Alright, okay
Uh, alright, okay
Alright, okay
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope-nope, y'all can't copy
Yeah, bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said...
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Oh, oh, oh, oh (let's go)
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say
Na na na na, na na na na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And all my people say
Na na na na, na na na na
Mack-le-eh-eh-eh-eh-more!
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?
What-what, what, what?
What-what, what, what?
What-what, what, what?
What-what, what, what? (Da)
What-what, what, what? (Da-dum, ba-dum, ba-da-do-da)

No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you) 
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers

Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow

I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your grandad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (men's)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight"
I'm like, "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by a business
That shirt's hella dope
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand? Man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't
Goodwill
Poppin' tags, yeah
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'll wear your grandad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your grandad's clothes (damn right)
I look incredible (now come on, man)
I'm in this big-ass coat (big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (let's go, come on)
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
Hahaha
Is that your grandma's coat?
And on, on, and on, and on we go
And on, on, and on, and on we go
We love what we had but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
Same city, yeah, we can't break up
Nice mask on, wear the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked better in their make-up
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment, what's the matter?
She's learning that she never should have dated a rapper
I don't blame her, my mind is gone
I'm at dinner, checking phone calls, texts and blogs
I don't hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world, memorizing these songs
It goes on and on
Don't wanna break you
But I'm leading you on
O-o-o, o-o-o-on
And now it's gone
And on, on, and on, and on we go
And on, on, and on, and on we go
We love what we had but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know, we know
It's over
Over
Didn't believe in love, until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I'm on the homie's couch
Always going out, sleeping 'round with strangers
Danger, but you can't live without her
Now you're paranoid, checking on her cell phone
Making sure she ain't like you alone
Haven't made love with the lights still on
It's like you're hiding something from me
Let's fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy of me husband and you wife
Lyin', staring into those two eyes
And I can't take it, back to where we came from, my pavement
Past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let's keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out, then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us, baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love, maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to God, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and gettin' my heart thawed
Then I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed-off shotgun any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I've been living up outta my suitcase
Building trust and then I'm leaving on Tuesday
Find a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it's so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it
Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
And on, on, and on, and on we go
And on, on, and on, and on we go
We love what we had but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know, we know
It's over
When I was in the 3rd grade
I thought that I was gay
Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K"
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like
"Yeah, I'm good at little league"
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a predisposition
Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know
And God loves all His children
Is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written
35 hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay
I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately
"Man that's gay"
Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender and skin color
Complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church
They taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service
Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water
That you soak in
Is then poisoned
When everyone else
Is more comfortable
Remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans
That have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same
But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play
Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day
That my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful
Someone would rather die
Than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to startXX
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not cryin' on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not cryin' on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not cryin' on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not cryin' on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not cryin' on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd had done for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life
A true artist won't be satisfied
So I guess that's the sacrifice
And I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego won't swole until the karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, a necklace
What I really need is a job off craig's list
Take away the dot com, name, love, pants, it's were a father words in the bus
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
I said
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
Of course I want dubs and a candy painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track
Of course I want dubs and a candy painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true
And I said
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true, stay true
Forget about the fame
I said forget about the fame
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true, stay true
Aha
Uhm
One, two, now round here they sing broken hymns
They prayers flow better when they're soaked in gin
The amp's dusty and sits in the corner
By bartender that'll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that'll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There's a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don't cover it up
Watch their faces, familiar places
Even if they haven't left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that's so strong I'd be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I'm a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems drown themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it a night cap
Service starts at five tomorrow and I'll be right back
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I've misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns is perched atop my spine
Listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
I read the Bible, but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the churches
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, oh the Lord immerses
Blessed in holy water, the sin of Holy Father
Have you ever smelled flesh that sweats out Monarch Vodka?
11 a.m. in the morning and you can't get it off yet
Comment to the preacher, but it's like the pastor isn't talking
Until the store opens and I can re-up on that doctrine
The people close to me say I'm in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem, but these are not apostles
This is the drink of the Lord, that's according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you're judging it I don't want it
I got sins that scold like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I'm sinking and that's why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, bar more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I'm getting amnesia
Shaking 'til I'd get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Wouldn't miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the Neon Cathedral
Wouldn't miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God, Neon Cathedral
Neon Cathedral
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I've misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns is perched atop my spine
Listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
I wanna be free, I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac, that is my shit
Now throw it up (man, throw that up)
That's what it is (that's what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)
Can't see me through my tints (nuh-uh)
I'm ridin' real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, drippin', shinnin', like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain't got 24s (nuh-uh), but I'm on those Vogues (yeah)
That's those big white walls, r-r-round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I'm rollin' in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello, haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright-bright
Man, I'm loungin'
In some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of (woo)
Lookin' down from heaven like, damn, that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I'm illegally going 120
Easy weavin' in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashin'
I'm duckin', buckin' them out here
I'm lookin' fuckin' fantasic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Ridin' into the night, drivin' over the bridge
The same one we'd walk across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school (old), old school (old)
Candy paint (candy paint), two-seater (ow)
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either (ooh)
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And rolled on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in, as I was leavin' I started screamin'
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright-bright (yeah, uh)
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind (oh-oh)
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Sendin' portions of his liquor, water in the Patron
Drivin', smilin' like I won the fuckin' lottery homes (fuckin' lottery homes)
Uh (yeah), tires with the spokes on it (yeah), and the Vogues too (uh)
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hangin' out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, never park the whip
See what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my palms
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-some
Swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga, fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slice off when the gas is finished, Q
Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling up that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, I need all that shit
Steal myself a record deal
Steal myself a record deal
Steal myself a record deal
If I just went in and stole in, the police woulda noticed
Gotta be strategic, creep in, go in n' leave without motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, casing this building
Watching these rappers that rap and walk in and leave out with millions (millions)
Headed in sweating, open that front door
"Interscope" printed out right by the entrance
Door closes, not a metaphor
Then I start towards that front desk, right where you check in
Dressed in an uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue jumpsuit, rush you
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador (fuck you!)
Carrying two cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say, "third floor? I'm late, paintin' Jimmy lovine's office"
Holding my breath, 'bout to faint
I'm scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see, I'm breaking down if I don't make it out, then I'm leaving town with that contract
And I'm spazzing out, grabbing the A & R out
His chair and I'm taking him hostage
I don't give a fuck, step into the elevator, press three
Now I'm headed up (heist!)
What they don't know, there's a gun in the paint can
And I'm ready and willing to bust 'em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think?
If I can sign, my luck is destined, my future depends on ink
A secretary at the front of the entrance, staring right at me
I walk out, she whispers "go ahead" and then gives me a wink
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'Cause all I ever dreamt about was making it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, I need all that shit
If I get past security, the secretary, the cubicles
But it's weird, it's like this room I've walked into is unusual
Thought it'd be shiny and beautiful
Thought it'd be alive and like, musical
But it feels like someone died, it's got the vibe of a funeral
There's numbers on the chalkboard
CDs boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin' that they have nobody in-house
Wonderin' what they make art for
I start thinkin', am I in the right place? Just walk forward
See plaques on the wall
Aww yea, in a second, those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven sent
Big, block, silver letters, read it out loud, "President" (heist!)
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then, felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck
He said, "we've been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music get's so impressive and this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you're destined for greatness
And with that right song, we all know that you're next to be famous"
"Now I'm sorry, I've had a long day, remind me now what your name is?
That's right, 'Macklemore, ' of course today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? We'll give you one hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out, we'll need back that money that you borrowed"
Mm-hm, so it's really like a loan? "Alone? Come on, no!
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
You'll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you're out doing your shows
Manager gets 20, booking agent gets 10
So shit, after taxes, you and Ryan have seven percent to split
That's not bad, I've seen a lot worse
No one will give you a better offer than us"
"Mm-hm, " I replied, "I appreciate the offer
Thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist
Than succeed at getting fucked"
I was seven years old, when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, momma, this air bubble right here
It's gonna make me fly
I hit that court and when I jumped
I jumped, I swear I got so high
I touched the net, mom, I touched the net
This is the best day of my life
Air Max's were next
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffin', the tread
At school, I was so cool
I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em
Four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best
But my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue
So everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos' brother
Got murdered for his Fours, whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro
Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground
Wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins
I wanna fly
Can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down
We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em, so exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes
I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease 'em
Just leave 'em in that box
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost if it pops
We are what we wear
We wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror
And think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine, off
I wanna fly
Can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down
It started out with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love
They say thirty is the new twenty
And twenty is the new thirty shit I guess
Makes sense, cause fifteen year olds seem twenty
And twenty five year olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basshead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, whose got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
And cynical hipsters with long hair
Cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime
They say it's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth
The guns that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge her 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less cautious
The rappers rappin' 'bout them strippers up on the pole, copping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that it's poetry is so well spoken, stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there runners killing cop shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there is a new Rodney on Youtube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconcious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet, R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Don't wanna be that white dude, million man marchin'
Fighting for our freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talkin race, tryin' to save the fuckin' globe
Don't get involved with the causes in mind
White priveledge, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's nineteen ninty nine
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love
Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world's coated in the gold Krylon, yeah
And these days, days, days, they never run away
Gold tints, shades that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And g-g-give it away
When gold erupted from volcanoes in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melted
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the pharaohs
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can't take the bandaid when you're gone
Now I, now I-I-I'll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschläger faded, 14 carat plated, so we're feeling like gold
Five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
(Today we're feeling like gold)
So fresh head to toes
Goldschläger faded, 14 carat plated, so we're feeling like gold
Alright now, we open up
That car door, hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In Gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by sticking out just because
That's how you illustrate power and who you're above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since P was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight, we ball, we ball, we comin' up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin' on the sun
Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschläger faded, 14 carat plated, so we're feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Today we're feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that's two golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of 'em
Past the Space Needle, golden shower on pedestrians
Excuse me, that's my bad, that's my eagle and he shouldn't of
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet, bruh
And it's gold, two girls, gold brass
Lounging on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sipping on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They're sipping Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain't even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I'm kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschläger faded, 14 carat plated, so we're feeling like gold
Five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschläger faded, 14 carat plated, so we're feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So we're feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
One, two, now...
Those three-plus years, I was so proud of
Then I threw them all away for two Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that "He lied to me"
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fucking privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
A "08/10/08" that now has been changed
And everyone that put me in some box as a saint
That I never was, just a false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I've written has all been fake?
Or will I just take my slip to the grave?
What the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and you look at him directly into his face
Deceit on your shoulders, deceivingly heavy weight
Haven't seen tears like this on my girl in a while
The trust that I once built's been betrayed
But I'd rather live tellin' the truth than be judged for my mistakes
Than falsely held up, given props, loved and praised
I guess, I gotta get this on the page
Feelin' sick and helpless
Lost the compass where self is
I know what I've gotta do, and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em, yeah
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them
We fought so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought you'd go
But you were with me all along, along
And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean, now look at me
A couple days sober, I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the East Side, shakin', tweakin'
Hope that they don't see it, hope that no one is lookin'
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Just posted in the back with my hands crossed, shooken
If they call on me I'm passin' it, if they talk to me I'm bookin'
Out that door, but before I can make it
Somebody stops me and says "Are you Macklemore?
"Maybe this isn't the place or time, I just wanted to say that"
"If it wasn't for 'Otherside' I wouldn't have made it"
I just looked down at the ground and say "Thank you"
She tells me she has 9 months and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes lookin' like she's gonna cry, fuck
I barely got forty-eight hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I want to tell her I relapsed, but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her "Congrats"
Get back to my car, and I think I'm trippin', yeah
'Cause God wrote 'Otherside', that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man I fucked up
Like so many others, I just never thought I would
I never thought I would
Didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself didn't turn out that good
If I can be an example of gettin' sober
Then I can be an example of startin' over
If I can be an example of gettin' sober
Then I can be an example of startin' over
We fought so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought you'd go
But you were with me all along, along
We fought so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
Well, city kids, you get what you ask for
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends, they'll remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there's a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around the table and use those years as the centrepiece
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots, doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots, doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer, at least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days, I guess that's okay, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on, close the chapter, live separate lives
The 20-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes but those mistakes made you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality, rarely lit
Memories a collage pasted with glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locks, bathroom doors, graffiti and high heels
Until you felt the altitude, you don't know how high feels
Party Mountain, some don't ever come down from around here
Eh, to be young again, I guess it's relative
The camera lights, the whiskey rise, sink into the skin
I fantasise about a second wind
Grow my 'stache, pick up another bad habit and let the games begin
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots, doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots, doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
So here's to the nights dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one-night-stand
Brought a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You can bring a receipt to heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real, even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while just to say I visit
Can we hold on to these nights?
Try to find our way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends 'bout around 2 a.m.
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends, they'll remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there's a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around the table and use those years as the centrepiece
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots, doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Well you can party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle
This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Piston
Like Dennis Rodman, I got a rod man (aww yeah!)
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
And a ping-pong pink schlong, let's all dance!
From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was up on the roof beating up on a bongo
I got a bottle of Martin at least I'm jumping in
I love anybody that's kicking it in the plateau
And the name was keep tripping, like I'm in a castle
Fuck your condo!
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Well you can party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle
You like to party, I am a party-er
You like to wander, I am a wanderer
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?
I'm the lion, the witch in the wardrobe
Massaging my lap, I have a sore bone
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With those toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not
I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, Cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hooka, now make it drop
Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendin' you get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom
Make it wobble, wobbly-wobble 'till my third leg has to hobble
You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Well you can party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle
This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Eh, motherfuckin eh
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
In the night, in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Sit and kill a coyote, I'm starving
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Bring my bagpipe, I grab my flute
Cause drunk King John is still the loo
Get onto the pole in a birthday suit, our suit
With them Jay's, King, and Prince's pants
And Raven has whatever says
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Well you can party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle
I used to sit with my dad in the garage
That sawdust, that Pinesol and the moss
Around every spring when the winter thawed
We'd huddle around the radio twist the broken knob
710 AM, no KJR, Dave Niehaus' voice would echo throughout the yard
Couldn't have been older than ten
But to me and my friends
The voice on the other end might as well have been God's
1995, the Division Series
Edgar's up to bat
Bottom of the 11th inning
Got the whole town listening
"Swung on and belted", the words distorted
"Joey Cora rounds third
Here comes Griffey
The throw to the plate's not in time
My, oh my, the Mariners win it"
Yes! Fireworks, they lit up that ceiling in the Kingdome
We had just made history
"Swung on and lined down the left field line for a base hit!
Here comes Joey! Here is Junior to third base!
They're gonna wave him in! The throw to the plate will be late!
The Mariners are going to play for the American League Championship!
I don't believe it! It just continues! My oh my!"
Laces woven, barley holdin' that stitch
Creases are time amongst the grime and the grit
Where the leather he used to pound his fists
To some it's just a mitt, but see that glove was him
Yep, tell me stories on the field, with that sun stained brim
Blood under my chin, he taught me how to spit
Sunflower seeds back with me and my crew
Sun burnt arms
Big league chew
Yeah, we were like, "The Sandlot" after dinner
After practice we'd listen
To the M's in the kitchen
And if mom wasn't trippin'
"Come on dad! Please, I swear, just one more inning"
Voice went "Pump, pump!" through the system
"Break out the rye bread, it's grand salami time!"
"My, oh my! Another victory!"
Yes! My city, my city
Childhood, my life watchin' Griffey right under those lights
Under that light rain, gleaming in that night game, can't stop now
Keep moving, no break pads
Came here to prove a point, live my life on the field
Make history in between the base paths
And compete against the fear that is in me
That's my only barrier and I swear I'm going to break that from the mud
The cleats that we drug through the feet
This is that moment, and you cannot take it back, and
I don't really collect cards anymore
Just a box and some old cardboard
Memories embedded in the dust
In the fighters that age just like us
Livin' some where off in the drawer
This is what you make of it, yeah, we play to win
Live it like we're under the lights of the stadium
Fight until the day that God decides to wave us in
Right until he waves us in
It's my city, my city
Childhood, my life
That's right under those lights
My city, my city, childhood
That's right, Niehaus
My, oh my, come on
My city, my city
Childhood, my life
That's right under those lights
It's my city, my city
Childhood, my life
Niehaus, my, oh my
Rest in peace
And they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
'Cause you know you got a whole world to change
But understand who you got to change first"
And I was like "Fuck that", humility bust back
I remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
I was just a little shorty hoping that I could find a bum to buy a 40 for me
And have enough for a bud sack
Yeah, and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse, sipping on some lean I would let loose
Looking in the mirror, watching myself lose
Cleaned up in '08, got a job making barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with RL, performing in front of 8 people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
And I'm watching my pops in the back row grinning
With his glass up to my mom, toasting this Guinness
And we on (we on)
Good music, it lies in the ambiance
When we leave here
Will these words live on
Till then, we keep on making the songs
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
Put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
I remember that Freshman edition
Last year thinking to myself like
Yah, nah, I won't win it yet
Probably won't get it, but I'm gonna give it everything
Play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control and my souls mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city
Seattle that raised me
Rule four thousand eighty, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
Put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
Oh my God, feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit
And they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
'Cause you know you got a whole world to change
But understand who you got to change first"
Put 'em up, up up, up up
Up, up up, up up
Up, up up, up up
Macklemore, Ryan Lewis
Put 'em up, up up, up up
Up, up up, up up
Up, up up, up up (so high)
